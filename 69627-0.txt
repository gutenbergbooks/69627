The pleasantest things in the world are pleasant thoughts, and the
great art in life is to have as many of them as possible.--_Bovée._


To get peace, if you do want it, make for yourselves nests of pleasant
thoughts. None of us yet knows, for none of us has been taught in early
youth, what fairy palaces we may build of beautiful thoughts--proof
against all adversity. Bright fancies, satisfied memories, noble
histories, faithful sayings, treasure-houses of precious and restful
thoughts, which care cannot disturb, nor pain make gloomy, nor poverty
take away from us--houses built without hands for our souls to live
in.--_Ruskin._


  I saw the mountains stand
  Silent, wonderful, and grand,
  Looking out across the land
  When the golden light was falling
  On distant dome and spire;
  And I heard a low voice calling,
  “Come up higher, come up higher,
  From the lowland and the mire,
  From the mist of earth desire,
  From the vain pursuit of pelf,
  From the attitude of self;
  Come up higher, come up higher.”
                --_James G. Clarke._


The thrift of time will repay in after life with usury of profit
beyond your most sanguine dreams, and waste of it will make you
dwindle alike in intellectual and moral stature beyond your darkest
reckoning.--_Gladstone._


Never bear more than one kind of trouble at a time. Some people bear
three--all they have had, all they have now, and all they expect to
have.--_Edward Everett Hale._


  Age is opportunity no less
    Than youth itself, though in another dress;
  And as the evening twilight fades away
    The sky is filled with stars invisible by day.
                --_Longfellow._


If there is any person to whom you feel dislike, that is the person of
whom you ought never to speak.--_R. Cecil._


The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as in what
direction we are moving.--_Oliver Wendell Holmes._


In nature there is no blemish but the mind;--none can be called
deformed but the unkind.--_Shakespeare._


  “You never can tell what your thoughts will do,
    In bringing you hate or love;
  For thoughts are things, and their airy wings
    Are swifter than carrier doves.
  They follow the law of the universe,--
    Each thing must create its kind;
  And they speed o’er the track to bring you back
    Whatever went out from your mind.”


Do the duty which lies nearest thee, which thou knowest to be a duty.
Thy second duty will already have become clearer.--_Carlyle._


We need a revival of the individual. The question is not, What are they
doing?--but, What am I doing? Not, Why do you not do this, that, or
the other?--but, Why am not I doing this, that, or the other?--_Jenkin
Lloyd Jones._


That man is blessed who every day is permitted to behold anything so
pure and serene as the western sky at sunset, while revolutions vex the
world.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


  There’s life alone in duty done,
  And rest alone in striving.
                --_Whittier._


It is a matter of economy to be happy, to view life and all its
conditions from the brightest angle; it enables one to seize life at
its very best. It expands the soul.--_H. W. Dresser._


To educate the heart, one must be willing to go out of himself, and to
come into loving contact with Others.--_James Freeman Clarke._


Associate reverently, and as much as you can, with your loftiest
thought.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


This question then is ours--are we doing our part in the growth of the
race? In the current of life are we moving forward? Do our years mark
milestones in humanity’s struggle towards perfection? Is the God within
us so much more unrolled, when our development has reached its highest
point? Can we transmit to our children a better heritage of brain and
soul than our fathers left to us? Has the race through us gained some
little in the direction of the law of love? If we have done our part in
this struggle our lives have not been in vain.--_David Starr Jordan._


Virgil said of the winning crew in his boat-race, “They can, because
they believe they can.”


Let us be of good cheer, remembering that the misfortunes hardest to
bear are those which never come.--_Lowell._


To be wise we must first learn to be happy: for those who can finally
issue forth from self by the portal of happiness, know infinitely wider
freedom than those who pass through the gate of sadness.--_Maurice
Materlinck._


When we humor our weaknesses they force themselves continually upon
our attention, like spoiled children. When we assert our mastery of
ourselves and compel its recognition, we stand secure in our sovereign
rights.--_Chas. B. Newcomb._


Put away all sarcasm from your speech. Never complain. Do not prophesy
evil. Have a good word for everyone, or else keep silent.--_Henry Ward
Beecher._


  Boys flying kites haul in their white winged birds,
  You can’t do that way when you’re flying words.
  Thoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead,
  But God himself can’t stop them when they’re said.
                --_Will Carleton._


Mould conditions aright, and men will grow good to fit them.--_Horace
Fletcher._


Pride

  Is littleness; he who feels contempt
  For any living thing hath faculties
  Which he has never used.
                --_Wordsworth._


Treat your friends for what you know them to be. Regard no surfaces.
Consider not what they did, but what they intended.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


Small kindnesses, small courtesies, small considerations,
habitually practiced in our social intercourse, give a greater
charm to the character than the display of great talent and
accomplishments.--_Kelty._


I believe that the mind can be profaned by the habit of attending
to trivial things, so that all our thoughts shall be tinged with
triviality.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


Don’t hang a dismal picture on the wall, and do not daub with sables
and glooms in your conversation. Don’t be a cynic and disconsolate
preacher.--_Emerson._


No good thing is failure and no evil thing success.--_W. C. Gannett’s
favorite proverb._


  Wisdom is knowing what to do next;
      Skill is knowing how to do it, and Virtue is doing it.
                --_David Starr Jordan._


Always laugh when you can; it is a cheap medicine. Merriment
is a philosophy not well understood. It is the sunny side of
existence.--_Byron._


If we are not responsible for the thoughts that pass our doors, we are
at least responsible for those we admit and entertain.--_Charles B.
Newcomb._


  Not for the crying,
  Not for the loud beseeching
      Will peace draw near.
  Rest with palms folded,
  Rest with thine eyelids fallen,
      Lo! peace is here.
                --_E. R. Sill._


Would you remain always young, and would you carry all joy and buoyancy
of youth into your maturer years? Then have care concerning but one
thing--how you live in your thought world.--_R. W. Trine._


  Lord, for to-morrow and its needs
      I do not pray,
  Help me from stain of sin
      Just for to-day.

  Let me both diligently work
      And duly pray,
  Let me be kind in word and deed
      Just for to-day.

  Let me be slow to do my will,
      Prompt to obey,
  Help me to sacrifice myself
      Just for to-day.

  Let me no wrong or idle word
      Unthinking say,
  Put Thou Thy seal upon my lips
      Just for to-day.

  So for to-morrow and its needs
      I do not pray,
    But keep me, guide me, hold me, Lord,
      Just for to-day.
                --_Canon Farrar._


To live in love is to live an everlasting youth. Whoever enters old age
by this royal road will find the last of life to be the very best of
life. Instead of finding himself descending the hills of life, he will
find it up-hill all the way, into clearer air. There the vision reaches
further; here the sunsets are more golden and the twilight lasts
longer.--_Mrs. Mary A. Livermore._


Those who live on the mountain have a longer day than those who live
in the valley. Sometimes all we need to brighten our day is to rise a
little higher.--_Rev. S. J. Barrows._


Good luck is the willing handmaid of upright, energetic character, and
conscientious observance of duty.--_James Russell Lowell._


The highest compact we can make with our fellow is, let there be truth
between us two forevermore.--_Emerson._


Unfaithfulness in the keeping of an appointment is an act of
clear dishonesty. You may as well borrow a person’s money as his
time.--_Horace Mann._


  All service ranks the same with God--
  There is no last nor first.
                --_Browning._


Logic makes only one demand, that of conscience. But life makes a
thousand. The body wants health; the imagination cries out for beauty;
and the heart for love. Pride asks for consideration; the soul yearns
for peace; the conscience for holiness; our whole being is athirst for
happiness and for perfection.--_Amiel._


What if it does look like rain, it is fine now!--_William Smith._


Was there ever a wiser or more loving conspiracy than that which
keeps the venerable figure of Santa Claus from slipping away, with
all the other old-time myths, into the forsaken wonderland of the
past?--_Hamilton Wright Mabie._


Mankind are always happier for having been happy. So that if you make
them happy now, you make them happy twenty years hence by the memory of
it.--_Sydney Smith._


Never fancy you could be something if only you had a different lot and
sphere assigned you. The very things that you most deprecate, as fatal
limitations or obstructions, are probably what you most want. What
you call hindrances, obstacles, discouragements, are probably God’s
opportunities.--_Horace Bushnell._


  Who may not strive, may yet fulfil
  The harder task of standing still,
  And good but wished, with God is done.
                --_Whittier._


Happiness and the sense of victory are only for those who live for
conscience and duty and the soul’s higher ideals.--_Newell Dwight
Hillis._


“Try this for one day:--Think as though your thoughts were visible to
all about you.”


The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows whither he is
going.--_David Starr Jordan._


Beware lest thy friend learn to tolerate one frailty of thine, and so
an obstacle be raised to the progress of thy love.--_Thoreau._


As soon as a stranger is introduced into any company, one of the first
questions which all wish to have answered, is, How does that man get
his living? And with reason; every man is a consumer, and ought to
be a producer. He fails to make his place good in the world unless
he not only pays his debts but also adds something to the common
wealth.--_Emerson._


All impatience disturbs the circulation, scatters force, makes
concentration difficult if not impossible.--_C. B. Newcomb._


    When the sun of joy is hidden
  And the sky is overcast,
    Just remember light is coming
  And a storm can never last.
                --_J. B. Smiley._


There is no music in a rest, that I know of, but there is the making of
music in it.--_Ruskin._


      Our lives are songs;
      God writes the words,
  And we set them to music at leisure:
  And the song is sad, or the song is glad
  As we choose to fashion the measure.

      We must write the song,
      Whatever the words,
  Whatever its rhyme, or meter;
  And if it is sad, we must make it glad,
  And if sweet, we must make it sweeter.
                --_Gibbon._


    For what you find in these sweet days,
  Depends on how you go about it;
    A glad heart helps poor eyes to see,
  What brightest eyes can’t see without it.

    One child sees sunlit air and sky
  And bursting leaf buds, round and ruddy;
    Another looks at his own feet,
  And only sees that it is muddy!
                --_Henrietta R. Eliot._


    The work of the world is done by few;
    God asks that a part be done by you.
                --_Sarah K. Bolton._


This nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth.--_Abraham Lincoln._


We are haunted by an ideal life, and it is because we have within us
the beginning and the possibility of it.--_Phillips Brooks._


  Earth’s crammed with heaven,
  And every common bush afire with God.
                --_E. B. Browning._


Thoughts are forces: through their instrumentality we have in our
grasp, and as our rightful heritage, the power of making life and all
its manifold conditions exactly what we will.--_R. W. Trine._


People seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also a
confession of character.--_Emerson._


[Illustration: HORATIO STEBBINS

_The understanding is the vestibule of the mind! Uncover thy
head, and enter the temple of the soul! Behold the power, the
beauty and the love! If we had nothing but understanding, how
little should we know or think or feel!_]


Blessed are the Happiness Makers. Blessed are they who know how to
shine on one’s gloom with their cheer.--_Henry Ward Beecher._


The time will come when the civilized man will feel that the rights of
every living creature on the earth are as sacred as his own. Anything
short of this cannot be perfect civilization.--_David Starr Jordan._


    Search thine own heart. What paineth thee
  In others, in thyself may be;
    All dust is frail, all flesh is weak;
  Be thou the true man thou dost seek.
                --_Whittier._


Beware of despairing about yourself.--_St. Augustine._


  If you were born to honor, show it now:
  If put upon you, make the judgment good
  That thought you worthy of it.
                --_Shakespeare._


  Then a voice within his breast
    Whispered, audible and clear:
  “Do thy duty; that is best;
  Leave unto the Lord the rest!”
                --_Longfellow._


  “There are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave,
  There are souls that are pure and true;
  Then give to the world the best you have,
  And the best will come to you.
  Give love, and love to your heart will flow,
  A strength in your utmost need;
  Have faith, and a score of hearts will show
  Their faith in your word and deed.”


Fortune will call at the smiling gate.--_Japanese Proverb._


  “Talk health; the dreary never-ending tale
  Of mortal maladies is worn and stale.
  You cannot charm or interest or please
  By harping on that minor chord, disease.
  Say you are well, or all is well with you
  And God shall hear your words and make them true.”


Whenever you are angry, be assured that it is not only a present evil,
but that you have increased a habit.--_Epictetus._


How true it is that what we really see day by day depends less on the
objects and scenes before our eyes than on the eyes themselves and the
minds and hearts that use them.--_F. D. Huntington._


You have not fulfilled every duty, unless you have fulfilled that of
being pleasant.--_Charles Buxton._


If I am not for myself who will be for me? But if I am for myself alone
what am I? If not now--when?--_Hillel._


  I asked the New Year for some motto sweet,
  Some rule of life by which to guide my feet;
  I asked and paused. It answered, soft and low:
      “God’s will to know.”
  “Will knowledge then suffice, New Year?” I cried;
  But ere the question into silence died,
  The answer came: “Nay; this remember, too,
      God’s will to do.”
  “To know; to do; can this be all we give
  To Him in Whom we are, and move and live?
  No more, New Year?” “This, too, must be your care:
      God’s will to bear.”
  Once more I asked: “Is there still more to tell?”
  And once again the answer sweetly fell;
  “Yea, this one thing, all other things above;
      God’s will to love.”
                --_J. M. C. Bouchard, S. J._


Shun idleness, it is the rust that attaches itself to the most
brilliant metals.--_Voltaire._


Few men suspect how much mere talk fritters away spiritual energy--that
which should be spent in action, spends itself in words. Hence he who
restrains that love of talk lays up a fund of spiritual strength.--_F.
W. Robertson._


Truthfulness is the foundation of all personal excellence. It exhibits
itself in conduct. It is rectitude, truth in action, and shines through
every word and deed.--_Samuel Smiles._


The cry of the age is more for fraternity than for charity. If
one exists, the other will follow, or better still, will not be
needed.--_Dr. Henry D. Chapin._


There is philosophy as well as philanthropy in the keeping in touch
with all sweetness and love, in the being swift to be kind. This is
living on the spiritual plane, and spirituality is power.--_Lilian
Whiting._


Manners are the happy ways of doing things. If they are superficial,
so are the dewdrops, which give such a depth to the morning
meadows.--_Emerson._


  Being all fashioned of the self-same dust,
  Let us be merciful as well as just.
                --_Longfellow._


“The man who never makes mistakes loses a great many chances to learn
something.”


Why should a true and sincere appreciation be termed flattery, and
degraded to the level of insincere praise? Why should an individual
be accused of acting from base and selfish policy because he feels
the glow and warmth of social response?--_The World Beautiful, Lilian
Whiting._


Our power over others lies not so much in the amount of thought within
us as in the power of bringing it out.--_W. E. Channing._


Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each
other’s eyes for an instant?--_Thoreau._


Why should we wear black for the guests of God?--_Ruskin._


I always seek the good that is in people and leave the bad to Him who
made mankind and knows how to round off the corners.--_Goethe’s Mother._


  I am not concerned that I have no place,
  I am concerned how I may fit myself for one.
  I am not concerned that I am not known,
  I seek to be worthy to be known.
                --_Confucius._


The sunrise never failed us yet.--_Celia Thaxter._


Don’t bewail and bemoan. Omit the negative propositions. Nerve us with
incessant affirmations. Don’t waste yourself in rejection, nor bark
against the bad, but chant the beauty of the good.--_Emerson._


How the sting of poverty, or small means, is gone when one keeps
house for one’s own comfort, and not for the comfort of one’s
neighbors.--_Dinah Maria Mulock._


Culture is not an accident of birth, although our surroundings advance
or retard it; it is always a matter of individual education.--_Hamilton
W. Mabie._


No man need hunt for his mission. His mission comes to him. It is not
above, it is not below, it is not far--not to make happy human faces
now and then among the children of misery, but to keep happy human
faces about us all the time.--_J. F. W. Ware._


God’s best gift to us is not things, but opportunities.--_Alice W.
Rollins._


Whoever will prosper in any line of life must save his own time and do
his own thinking. He must spend neither time nor money which he has not
earned.--_David Starr Jordan._


I pray you, O excellent wife, not to cumber yourself and me to get a
rich dinner for this man or this woman who has alighted at our gate,
nor a bed-chamber made ready at too great a cost. These things they
can get for a dollar at any village. But let this stranger, if he
will, in your looks, in your accent, and behavior, read your heart and
earnestness, your thought and will, which he cannot buy at any price in
any village or city, and which he may well travel fifty miles and dine
sparely and sleep hard in order to behold. Certainly, let the board be
spread and let the bed be dressed for the traveler; but let not the
emphasis of hospitality lie in these things. Honor to the house where
they are simple to the verge of hardship, so that there the intellect
is awake and reads the laws of the Universe.--_Emerson._


[Illustration: JOHN VANCE CHENEY

  _The happiest heart that ever beat
    Was in some quiet breast,
  That found the common daylight sweet
    And left to heaven the rest._]


“The secret of the joy of living is the proper appreciation of what we
actually possess.”


  So then believe that every bird that sings,
    And every flower that stars the elastic sod,
  And every thought the happy summer brings
    To the pure spirit is a word of God.--_Coleridge._


Thrust an Emerson into any Concord, and his pungent presence will
penetrate the entire region. Soon all who come within the radius of
his life respond to his presence as flowers and trees respond with
boughs, brilliant and fragrant, to the sunshine. After a little, each
Emerson stands girt about with Hawthornes, Whittiers, Holmeses and
Lowells.--_Newell Dwight Hillis._


Make it your habit not to be critical about small things.--_Edward
Everett Hale._


The nobler life is just as possible to us all as that which is ignoble.
The moment one will assert his freedom from petty cares, perplexities,
troubles, and anxieties, that moment they fall off of themselves.--_A
Study of Mrs. Browning, Lilian Whiting._


He approaches nearest to the gods who knows how to be silent even
though he knows he is in the right.--_Cato._


  Ah! let us hope that to our praise
    Good God not only reckons
  The moments when we tread His ways,
    But when the spirit beckons--
  That some slight good is also wrought
    Beyond self-satisfaction,
  When we are simply good in thought,
    Howe’er we fail in action.
                --_Lowell._


We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly
listening, we shall hear the right word.--_Emerson._


When a man has not a good reason for doing a thing, he has one reason
for letting it alone.--_Sir Walter Scott._


Pure religion as taught by Jesus Christ is a life, a growth, a divine
spirit within, coming out in love and sympathy and helpfulness to our
fellow-men.--_Dr. H. W. Thomas._


Be sure of the foundation of your life. Know why you live as you do. Be
ready to give a reason for it. Do not, in such a matter as life, build
on opinion or custom, or what you guess is true. Make it a matter of
certainty and science.--_Thomas Starr King._


Nothing raises the price of a blessing like its removal; whereas, it
was its continuance which should have taught us its value.--_Hannah
More._


The soul occupied with great ideas, best performs small duties.--_James
Martineau._


Christianity wants nothing so much in the world as sunny people, and
the old are hungrier for love than for bread. The Oil of Joy is very
cheap, and if you can help the poor with a Garment of Praise, it will
be better for them than blankets.--_Drummond._


You will find it less easy to uproot faults than to choke them by
gaining virtues. Do not think of your faults, still less of others’
faults. In every person who comes near you look for what is good and
strong; honor that; rejoice in it; and as you can, try to imitate
it; and your faults will drop off like dead leaves, when their time
comes.--_Ruskin._


When you hold persistently to the successful mental state, you become a
magnet drawing other people to aid you as you in return can aid them.
But if you are much of the time despondent and gloomy, you become the
negative magnet driving the best from you.--_Prentice Mulford._


There are two days about which nobody should ever worry, and these are
yesterday and to-morrow.--_Robert J. Burdette._


A child, however educated, is still untaught if by his teaching we have
not emphasized his individual character, if we have not strengthened
his will and its guide and guardian, the mind.--_David Starr Jordan._


  “I am only a child who is lying
    On the bosom of Infinite Love.
  I speak not of living or dying;
  I know not of sorrow or crying;
    My thoughts are dwelling above.

  “The spring of the life that is flowing
    Is hidden with Christ in God.
  Not yet the mystery knowing,
  I feel that the peace is growing,
    As a river grows deep and broad.

  “All I need without price I am buying
    By my trust in the Goodness above.
  There’s an end to my yearning and sighing,
  For just like a child I am lying
    On the bosom of Infinite Love.”


The optimist, by his superior wisdom and insight, is making his own
heaven, and in the degree that he makes his own heaven, is he helping
to make one for all the world beside.--_R. W. Trine._


Do not let your head run upon that which is none of your own, but pick
out some of the best of your circumstances, and consider how eagerly
you would wish for them, were they not in your possession.--_Marcus
Aurelius._


Insist on your self; never imitate. There is at this moment for you an
utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or
the pen of Moses or Dante, but different from these. If you can hear
what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the same
pitch of voice.--_Emerson._


  Just because there’s fallen
    A snow-flake on his forehead,
  He must go and fancy
    ’Tis winter all the year!
                --_Aldrich._


How poor they are that have not patience.--_Shakespeare._


O God, animate us to cheerfulness! May we have a joyful sense of our
blessings, learn to look on the bright circumstances of our lot, and
maintain a perpetual contentedness.--_W. E. Channing._


  Thy love shall chant its own beatitudes
  After its own self-working. A child’s kiss
  Set on the sighing lips shall make thee glad;
  A poor man served by thee shall make thee rich;
  A sick man helped by thee shall make thee strong;
  Thou shalt be served thyself by every sense
  Of service which thou renderest.
                --_E. B. Browning._


  “Then take this honey for the bitterest cup;
  There is no failure, save in giving up;
  No real fall so long as one still tries,
  For seeming setbacks make the strong man wise.
  There’s no defeat, in truth, save from within;
  Unless you’re beaten there, you’re bound to win.”


  A crowd of troubles passed him by
    As he with courage waited;
  He said, “Where do you troubles fly
    When you are thus belated?”
  “We go,” they say, “to those who mope,
    Who look on life dejected,
  Who weakly say ‘good-bye’ to hope,
    We go where we’re expected.”
                --_Francis J. Allison._


  “Bring me men to match my mountains,
  Bring me men to match my plains;
  Men with empires in their purpose
  And new eras in their brains.”


  “Who will remember that skies are gray
  If he carries a happy heart all day?”


A man is specially and divinely fortunate, not when his conditions
are easy, but when they evoke the very best that is in him; when they
provoke him to nobleness, and sting him to strength, when they clear
his vision, kindle his enthusiasm and inspire his will.--_Hamilton
Wright Mabie._


The deeper the feeling the less demonstrative will be the expression of
it.--_Balzac._


The most I can do for my friend is simply to be his friend. If he
knows I am happy in loving him, he will want no other reward.--_H. D.
Thoreau._


“Live blameless; God is near.”--_Inscribed over the door of the house
of Linnæus, at Hammerby, Sweden._


It is always good to know, if only in passing, charming human beings.
It refreshes one like flowers and woods and clear brooks.--_George
Eliot._


Do not discharge in haste the arrow which can never return: it is easy
to destroy happiness; most difficult to restore it.--_Herder._


Disappointment should always be taken as a stimulant, and never viewed
as a discouragement.--_C. B. Newcomb._


  In all the crowded Universe
  There is but one stupendous word: Love.
  There is no tree that rears its crest,
  No fern or flower that cleaves the sod
  Nor bird that sings above its nest,
  But tries to speak this word of God.
                --_J. G. Holland._


  He who has a thousand friends has not one friend to spare,
  And he who has one enemy shall meet him everywhere.
                --_From the Arabic._


It is a great folly not to part with your own faults, which is
possible, but to try instead to escape from other people’s faults, which
is impossible.--_Marcus Aurelius._


“To persuade one soul to lead a better life is to leave the world
better than you found it.”


If you intend to be happy, don’t be foolish enough to wait for a just
cause.--_Chap-Book._


    Don’t borrow a creed from other people,
  Nor hang most faith on the stoutest steeple.
  Look up for your law, but oh! look higher
  Than the hands on any human spire.
  If ten think alike, and you think alone,
  That never proves ’tis ten to one
  They are right, you wrong; for truth, you see,
  Is not a thing of majority.
  It never can make you false, them true,
  That there’s more of them than there is of you:
  If your touch is on Truth’s garment’s hem,
  There is more of you than a world of them.
  ’Tis not alone in the Orient region
  That a certain hero’s name is Legion.
  Nor was it only for once to be
  That the whole herd together ran down to the sea.

  Your zenith for no man else is true:
  Your beam from the sun comes alone to you.
  And the thought the great God gave your brain
  Is your own for the world, or the world’s in vain.
                --_Edward Rowland Sill._


Discontent is want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of
will.--_Emerson._


“He that brings sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from
himself.”


Give us, oh, give us, the man who sings at his work! Be his occupation
what it may, he is equal to any of those who follow the same pursuit
in silent sullenness. He does more in the same time--he will do it
better--he will persevere longer.--_Carlyle._


Set about what thou intendest to do: the beginning is half the
battle.--_Cæsar._


By the street of By-and-By, one arrives at the house of
Never.--_Cervantes._


No wind serves him who has no destined port.--_Montaigne._


Be sure you give men the best of your wares though they be poor
enough; and the gods will help you to lay by a better store for the
future.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


Reading is indeed to the mind as food is to the body--the material of
which its fibre is made. It is surprising to note the difference in the
quality of mental thought which even one-half hour’s good reading each
day will make.--_Lilian Whiting._


      Men are four:
  He who knows, and knows he knows,--
      He is wise--follow him.
  He who knows, and knows not he knows,--
      He is asleep--wake him:--
  He who knows not, and knows not he knows not,--
      He is a fool--shun him.
  He who knows not, and knows he knows not,--
      He is a child--teach him.
                --_Arabian Proverb._


Cherish ideals as the traveler cherishes the north star, and keep the
guiding light pure and bright and high above the horizon.--_Newell
Dwight Hillis._


The days come and go like muffled and veiled figures sent from a
distant friendly party; but they say nothing, and if we do not use the
gifts they bring, they carry them as silently away.--_Emerson._


  ’Tis not in seeking,
  ’Tis not in endless striving,
      Thy quest is found.
  Be still and listen,
  Be still and drink the quiet
      Of all around.
                --_E. R. Sill._


To keep one’s foot firmly set in the way that leads upwards, however
dark and thorny it may be at the moment, is to conquer.--_The World
Beautiful, Lilian Whiting._


  And daily, hourly, loving and giving
  In the poorest life makes heavenly living.
                --_Rose Terry Cooke._


To love is the great glory, the last culture, the highest happiness; to
be loved is little in comparison.--_The Story of William and Lucy Smith,
                         George S. Merriam._


To persevere in one’s duty, and to be silent, is the best answer to
calumny.--_Washington._


I have lived to know that the secret of happiness is never to allow
your energies to stagnate.--_Adam Clarke._


Entertaining is the finest of all the fine arts, and it cannot be done
by proxy. It cannot be done by the cook, nor yet by the decorator. Let
the hostess give her guests her personal interest, her sympathetic
comprehension, and she will have then mastered the delicate and subtle
art.--_Lilian Whiting._


Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at
all.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


I am primarily engaged to myself to be a public servant to all
the gods, to demonstrate to all men that there is a good will and
intelligence at the heart of things, and ever higher and yet higher
leadings.--_Emerson._


  Be noble, and the nobleness that lies
  In other men, sleeping, but never dead,
  Will rise in majesty to meet thine own;
  Then shalt thou see it gleam in many eyes,
  Then will pure light about thy way be shed.
                --_Lowell._


Few causes age the body faster than wilful indolence and monotony of
mind--the mind, that very principle of physical youthfulness.--_James
Lane Allen._


“To speak wisely may not always be easy, but not to speak ill requires
only silence.”


If you have not slept, or if you have slept, or if you have a headache,
or sciatica, or leprosy, or thunder stroke, I beseech you by all the
angels to hold your peace, and not pollute the morning, to which all
the housemates bring serene and pleasant thoughts, by corruptions and
groans.--_Emerson._


  “‘Downward the path of life!’ Oh, no!
  Up, up, with patient steps, I go;
  I watch the skies fast brightening there;
  I breathe a sweeter, purer air.”


Happiness rarely is absent. It is we that know not of its presence.
The greatest felicity avails us nothing if we know not that we are
happy.--_Maurice Materlinck._


  There is no good in life but love--but love!
  What else looks good, is some shade flung from love;
  Love gilds it, gives it worth.
                --_Robert Browning._


[Illustration: Oliver Wendell Holmes

_The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as
in what direction we are moving._]


Instead of a gem, or even a flower, cast the gift of a lovely thought
into the heart of a friend.--_Geo. Macdonald._


Be satisfied with nothing but your best.--_Edward Rowland Sill._


Do not think it wasted time to submit yourself to any influence that
will bring upon you any noble feeling.--_Ruskin._


Thank God every morning when you get up that you have something to do
that day, which must be done whether you like it or not. Being forced
to work, and forced to do your best, will breed in you ... a hundred
virtues which the idle never know.--_Charles Kingsley._


Foresight is very wise, but foresorrow is very foolish; and castles
are, at any rate, better than dungeons in the air.--_Sir John Lubbock._


It requires a sterner virtue than good nature to hold fast the truth,
that it is nobler to be shabby and honest, than to do things handsomely
in debt.--_Juliana H. Ewing._


“Drop the subject when you cannot agree; there is no need to be bitter
because you know you are right.”


It is not only a part of the wisdom of happiness, but it is absolutely
essential to the conditions of any true work in the world, to so
live that one may not be too greatly affected by the attitude of
other people. A man’s life is, after all, primarily between God and
himself.--_Lilian Whiting._


Get your distaff ready, and God will send you flax.--_Mary A.
Livermore’s favorite proverb._


The thoughts that come often unsought, and, as it were, drop into the
mind, are commonly the most valuable we have, and therefore should be
secured, because they seldom return again.--_Locke._


  The little worries that we meet each day
  May be as stumbling-blocks across our way,
  Or we may make them stepping-stones to be
  Of grace, O Lord, to Thee!
                --_A. E. Hamilton._


A man’s own good breeding is the best security against other people’s
ill manners.--_Chesterfield._


The best teacher of duties that still lie near to us, is the practice
of those we see and have at hand.--_Carlyle._


“The secret of a sweet and Christian life is learning to live by the
day. It is the long stretches that tire us.”


To one who is in the rôle of host there can be no more bitter rebuke
than to have any guest or chance caller go out from the portals with
the feeling that he is sorry he came--that he is depressed rather
than up-lifted. For all personal association, whether permanent or
transient, whether prearranged or a matter of accidental contact,
should leave behind it a lingering charm, a deeper sense of the
loveliness of life.--_Lilian Whiting._


One of the natural tendencies of the mortal mind is toward proselyting.
The moment we believe something to be true, we begin to try to convert
others to our belief. We learn to say, with some degree of realization,
“God worketh in me to will and to do of His good pleasure,” but we
quite forget that the same God is working equally in our brother
“to will and to do.” “I am the door,” says the Christ within every
man’s own soul. Now you are trying to have your dear one enter in
through your door. He must enter in through his own Christ, his own
desire.--_H. Emilie Cady._


You may not be able to leave your children a great inheritance, but day
by day you may be weaving coats for them which they will wear through
all eternity.--_T. L. Cuyler._


He that cannot forgive others, breaks the bridge over which he must
pass himself; for every man has need to be forgiven.--_Lord Herbert._


We exhaust our strength in our impatience at our work, and the
conditions that surround us. There is nothing that comes to us which we
could not do easily with true adjustment, but we waste our forces in
our worries.--_C. B. Newcomb._


It seems as if heroes had done almost all for the world that they
can do; and not much more can come until common men awake and
take their common tasks. I believe the common man’s task is the
hardest.--_Phillips Brooks._


When we climb to heaven ’tis on the rounds of love to men.--_Whittier._


When you find a person a little better than his word, a little
more liberal than his promise, a little more than borne out in his
statements by facts, a little larger in deed than in speech, you
recognize a kind of eloquence in that person’s utterance not laid down
in Blair or Campbell.--_Holmes._


Young man! let the nobleness of your mind impel you to its improvement.
You are too strong to be defeated, save by yourself.--_W. D. Howard._


What we earnestly aspire to be, that in some sense we are.--_Anna
Jameson._


The mark of the man of the world is absence of pretension. He does not
make a speech, he takes a low business tone, avoids all brag, promises
not at all, performs much. He calls his employment by its lowest names,
and so takes from evil tongues their sharpest weapon.--_Emerson._


“In judging others, weigh carefully the method against the motive. If
the latter be pure, be patient and charitable, however different from
your own the method may be.”


“Refuse to regard as unfortunate the treatment you receive from others;
let it stimulate you to deal more justly with yourself and with them.”


The strength of affection is a proof not of the worthiness of the
object, but of the largeness of the soul which loves.--_F. W.
Robertson._


Every flower is a hint of His beauty; every grain of wheat a token of
His beneficence; every atom of dust, a revelation of His power. In and
through all things He is attracting our regard.--_Furness._


One never speaks of himself except at a loss.--_Montaigne._


It is easy in the world, to live after the world’s opinion: it is easy
in solitude, to live after our own. But the great man is he who in the
midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of
solitude.--_Emerson._


      If you knew the light
  That your soul casts in my sight,
      How I look to you
      For the good and true,
  The beauteous and the right.
                --_Robert Browning._


Manners impress as they indicate real power. A man who is sure of his
point, carries a broad and contented expression, which everybody reads.
And you cannot rightly train one to an air and manner, except by making
him the kind of man of whom that manner is the natural expression.
Nature forever puts a premium on reality.--_Emerson._


  Who looks to Heaven alone to save his soul
  May keep the path, but will not reach the goal:
  But he who walks in love may wander far,
  And God will bring him where the blessed are.
                --_Henry Van Dyke._


  “If you and I--just you and I--
  Should laugh instead of worry;
  If we should grow--just you and I--
  Kinder and sweeter hearted,
  Perhaps in some near by and by
  A good time might get started;
  Then what a happy world ’twould be
  For you and me--for you and me!”


  Let nothing disturb thee,
  Nothing affright thee;
  All things are passing;
  God never changeth;
  Patient endurance
  Attaineth to all things;
  Who God possesseth
  In nothing is wanting;
  Alone God sufficeth.
                --_Longfellow._


The world is full of judgment-days, and in every assembly that a man
enters, in every action he attempts, he is gauged and stamped. A man
passes for what he is worth.--_Emerson._


Life is noble in proportion to the nobleness of faith; it is successful
in proportion to the fixedness of faith.--_Joseph Le Conte._


We should tell ourselves once for all that it is the first duty of the
soul to become as happy, complete, independent, and great as lies in
its power.--_Maurice Materlinck._


“Cold and reserved natures should remember that though not infrequently
flowers may be found beneath the snow, it is chilly work to dig for
them, and few care to take the trouble.”


Whenever we send out loving thought in generous profusion, every part
of our environment echoes back a sweet benediction.--_Henry Wood._


A good book, whether a novel or not, is one that leaves you farther on
than when you took it up. If when you drop it, it drops you down in the
same old spot, with no finer outlook, no clearer vision, no stimulated
desires for that which is better and higher, it is in no sense a good
book.--_Anna Warner._


Silence is a great peacemaker.--_Longfellow._


Each act of humble service is that divine touching of the ground which
enables one to get the spring whereby he leaps to greater heights.--_R.
W. Trine._


Every noble life leaves the fibre of it interwoven forever in the works
of the world.--_Ruskin._


“It is no use running; to set out betimes is the main point.”


One ought never to speak of the faults of one’s friends; it mutilates
them. They can never be the same afterward.--_William D. Howells._


Whatever betide, every misfortune must be overcome by enduring
it.--_Virgil._


“Never argue with a man who talks loud. You couldn’t convince him in a
thousand years.”


The new science perceives that instincts and aspirations in the mind
are facts of nature that must be interpreted and accounted for by
reason as truly as a stone in the hand.--_Newell Dwight Hillis._


Work and love: that is the body and soul of the human being. Happy he
where they are one.--_Auerbach._


You picture to yourself the beauty of bravery and steadfastness. And
then some little, wretched, disagreeable duty comes which is your
martyrdom, the lamp for your oil; and if you do not do it, your oil is
spilled.--_Phillips Brooks._


“Watch the thought you hold for the neighbor who is yet living in the
consciousness of truth as you understand it. As you are taught of the
Spirit, so will he be taught in the way best adapted to him.”


Why do we so often prefer to believe in the necessity of suffering and
weakness rather than in the possibility of strength and gladness?--_C.
B. Newcomb._


Great powers and natural gifts do not bring privileges to their
possessor, so much as they bring duties.--_Henry Ward Beecher._


  Every day should have some part
  Free for the Sabbath of the heart.
                --_Wordsworth._


The beautiful is as useful as the useful.--_Victor Hugo._


The higher education of women means more for the future than all
conceivable legislative reforms. Its influence does not stop with the
home.--_David Starr Jordan._


“It is not the spurt at the start, but the continued, unresting,
unhasting advance that wins the day.”


That which is past is gone and irrevocable, and wise men have enough to
do with things present and to come.--_Francis Bacon._


  Whichever way the wind doth blow
  Some heart is glad to have it so;
  Then blow it east or blow it west,
  The wind that blows, that wind is best.
                --_Caroline A. Mason._


A lady’s dress should be such as to please God, not laying aside taste,
for is He not much more pleased when His children look well than
otherwise? I have no idea that Christ was negligent of his dress. His
garment was one counted worthy of casting lots upon.--_Mary Lyon._


Experience shows that success is due less to ability than to zeal. The
winner is he who gives himself to his work, body and soul.--_Charles
Buxton._


  “The smelter bends above his pot of silver
    Watching its restless heavings to and fro,
  ’Till ready for the careful coiner,
    His face reflected, the fused metal show.”


It is monotony which eats the heart out of joy, destroys the
buoyancy of the spirit, and turns hope to ashes; it is monotony
which saps the vitality of the emotions; depletes the energy of the
will, and finally turns the miracle of daily existence into dreary
commonplace. And monotony has its roots, not in our conditions, but in
ourselves.--_Hamilton Wright Mabie._


Begin, therefore, with little things. Is it a little oil spilt or a
little wine stolen? Say to yourself, this is the price paid for peace
and tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing. And when you
call your servant, consider that it is possible he may not come at your
call, or, if he does, that he may not do what you wish. But it is not
at all desirable for him, and very undesirable for you, that it should
be in his power to cause you any disturbance.--_Epictetus._


Let us never forget that an act of goodness is of itself an act of
happiness. No reward coming after the event can compare with the sweet
reward that went with it.--_Maurice Materlinck._


I said, “I will go out and look for mine enemies,” and that day I found
no friends. Again, I said, “I will go out and look for my friends,” and
that day I found no enemies.--_Gertrude R. Lewis._


Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of
thy mind, for the soul is dyed by the thoughts.--_Marcus Aurelius._


Have faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.--_Confucius._


“If you will call your ‘troubles’ ‘experiences,’ and remember that
every experience develops some latent force within you, you will grow
vigorous and happy, however adverse your circumstances may seem to be.”


Wanting to have a friend is altogether different from wanting to be a
friend. The former is a mere natural human craving, the latter is the
life of Christ in the soul.--_J. R. Miller._


When we cultivate thoughts of strength for others, we ourselves grow
strong. Habitual thoughts of peace bring us tranquillity.--_C. B.
Newcomb._


All high happiness has in it some element of love; all love contains a
desire for peace. One immediate effect of new happiness is to make us
turn toward the past with a wish to straighten out its difficulties,
heal its breaches and forgive its wrongs.--_James Lane Allen._


  When I am very weary
    I do not try to pray.
  I only shut my eyes, and wait
  To hear what God will say.
  Such rest it is to wait for Him
    As comes no other way.
                --_Alice E. Worcester._


You have not fulfilled every duty unless you have fulfilled that of
being pleasant.--_Charles Buxton._


We do a great deal of shirking in this life on the ground of not being
geniuses.--_Rose E. Cleveland._


We never know for what God is preparing us in His schools--for what
work on earth, for what work in the hereafter. Our business is to do
our work well in the present place, whatever that may be.--_Dr. Lyman
  Abbott._


Health is the first of all liberties, and happiness gives us the energy
which is the basis of health.--_Amiel’s Journal._


  Not in the clamor of the crowded street,
  Nor in the shouts and plaudits of the throng,
  But in ourselves, are triumph and defeat.
                --_Longfellow._


Whatever you may be sure of, be sure of this, that you are dreadfully
like other people.--_James Russell Lowell._


There is a dust that settles on the heart as well as that which rests
upon the ledge. It is better to wear out than to rust out.--_Sir John
Lubbock._


How many a thing which we cast to the ground, when others pick it up
becomes a gem.--_George Meredith._

Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces up, snow is
exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only
different kinds of good weather.--_Ruskin._


  A haze on the far horizon,
  The infinite, tender sky;
  The ripe, rich tint of the corn-fields,
  And the wild geese sailing high;
  And all over upland and lowland

  I built a chimney for a comrade old,

  And then I traveled on in winters cold;

                --_Edwin Markham._


Flowers, says Ruskin, seem intended for the solace of ordinary
humanity. Children love them; quiet, tender, contented, ordinary people
love them as they grow; they are the cottager’s treasure; and in the
crowded town mark, as with a little broken fragment of rainbow, the
windows of the workers in whose heart rests the covenant of peace.


Great privileges never go save in company with great
responsibilities.--_Hamilton W. Mabie._


He who has a high standard of living and thinking will certainly do
better than he who has none at all.--_Samuel Smiles._


You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments that
stand out, the moments when you have really lived, are the moments when
you have done things in a spirit of love.--_Henry Drummond._


And let him go where he will, he can only find so much beauty or worth
as he carries.--_Emerson._


As you grow ready for it, somewhere or other you will find what is
needful for you--in a book, or a friend, or, best of all, in your
own thoughts, the eternal thought speaking in your thought.--_George
Macdonald._


  Be thou the rainbow to the storms of life!
  The evening beam that smiles the clouds away
  And tints to-morrow with prophetic ray.
                --_Byron._


Displays of moral excellence, truths set forth in living actions, are
multiplied as they are shown. Men are won by what they approve. They
are led to imitate what they admire. Laudable actions never stand
alone. They go from eye to eye, from heart to heart, creating fresh
copies of their immortal worth.--_Dr. Frothingham._


  Wouldst shape a noble life? Then cast
  No backward glances toward the past,
  And though somewhat be lost and gone,
  Yet do thou act as one new-born;
  What each day needs, that shalt thou ask,
  Each day will set its proper task.
                --_Goethe._


We should think just as though our thought were visible to all
about us. Real character is not outward conduct, but quality of
thinking.--_Henry Wood._


It is a much shallower and more ignoble occupation to detect faults
than to discover beauties.--_Carlyle._


Whatever you wish to accomplish, be willing to do, and to commence your
work at once, right where you find yourself, and decide that you do not
want anything better to begin with than the conditions that surround
you, for God is with you.--_Raja Yoga._


No one is respectable who is not doing his best.--_Horace Fletcher._


The broad-minded see the truth in different religions; the
narrow-minded see only their differences.--_Chinese Proverb._


  The dawn is not distant,
  Nor is the night starless;
    Love is eternal!
  God is still God, and
  His faith shall not fail us;
    Christ is eternal!
                --_Longfellow._


  Let us be like the bird for a moment perched
    On a frail branch while he sings;
  Though he feels it bend, yet he sings his song,
    Knowing that he hath wings.
                --_Victor Hugo._


    Let us love so well
  Our work shall still be sweeter for our love,
  And still our love be sweeter for our work.
                --_Elizabeth Barrett Browning._


  “If you have gracious words to say
  Oh, give them to our hearts to-day,
  But if your words will cause us sorrow,
  Pray keep them till the last to-morrow.”


  High thoughts and noble in all lands
  Help me: my soul is fed by such.
  But ah, the touch of life and hands,
      The human touch!
  Warm, vital, close, life’s symbols dear,
  These need I most, and now, and here.
                --_Richard Burton._


To live in the presence of great truths and eternal laws, to be led
by permanent ideals,--that is what keeps a man patient when the world
ignores him, and calm and unspoiled when the world praises him.--_Dr.
A. Peabody._


The test of an enjoyment is the remembrance which it leaves
behind.--_Jean Paul._


No education is complete, nor, indeed, of great permanent value,
that does not teach how to live contentedly and to economize nerve
energy.--_Mary Roberts Smith._


I have seen manners that make a similar impression with personal
beauty, that give us the like exhilaration, and refine us like that.
But they must be marked by fine perception, they must always show
self-control. Then they must be inspired by the good heart.--_Emerson._


Patience! have faith and thy prayer will be answered.--_Longfellow._


“Sentiment cannot do duty for humanity.”


The life of a man consists not in seeing visions and in dreaming
dreams, but in active charity and in willing service.--_Longfellow._


We find in life exactly what we put into it.--_Emerson._


Every duty we omit obscures some truth we should have known.--_Ruskin._


From Socrates to Browning the thinkers and poets have all been
emancipators. In the end, this bringing of new light into the minds of
the world will be counted their chief service.--_Hamilton W. Mabie._


  By all means use sometimes to be alone.
  Salute thyself: see what thy soul doth wear.
  Dare to look in thy chest--for ’tis thine own,--
  And tumble up and down what thou findest there.
  Who cannot rest till he good fellows finde,
  He breaks up house, turns out of doors his minde.
                --_George Herbert._


Personal happiness is almost synonymous with personal interests;
the wider the range of the latter, the higher is the degree of
happiness.--_Lilian Whiting._


Thoughts of courage, and hope, and highest expectation growing
habitual, may lift out and up many a weary pilgrim.--_L. Purington._


“The ornaments of a home are the guests who frequent it.”


Do not waste a minute--not a second--in trying to demonstrate to others
the merit of your own performance. If your work does not vindicate
itself, you cannot vindicate it.--_Thomas Wentworth Higginson._


To go about moping, depressed, blue, out of spirits in general, is to
exist, but not to live. It is the condition of a mollusk, and unworthy
a human being. Worry is a state of spiritual corrosion. A trouble
either can be remedied, or it cannot. If it can be, then set about
it; if it cannot be, dismiss it from your consciousness, or bear it
so bravely that it may become transfigured to a blessing.--_Lilian
Whiting._


  “It is easy enough to be pleasant
    When life flows by like a song,
  But the man worth while is the man who will smile
    When everything goes dead wrong;
  For the test of the heart is trouble,
    And it always comes with years,
  And the smile that comes with the praises of earth
    Is the smile that shines through tears.”


I think we should treat our minds as innocent children whose guardian
we are--be careful what objects and what subjects we thrust on their
attention.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


Gather roses while they blossom; to-morrow is not to-day! Allow no
moment to escape; to-morrow is not to-day.--_Gleim._


Cheapness of nature can be redeemed only from one source--that of
the invisible power on the divine side of life. By seeking this in
silence and concentration for a little time each day all refinement and
loveliness and charm can be achieved. It is the magic of life.--_The
World Beautiful, Lilian Whiting._


I have wished to teach a single lesson, true alike to all men--the
lesson of the saving of time.--_David Starr Jordan._


There are so many things--best things--that can only come when youth is
past, that it may well happen to many of us to find ourselves happier
and happier to the last.--_George Eliot._


        This world is no blot for us
  Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good.
                --_Browning._


Poetry frequents and keeps habitable those upper chambers of the mind
that open toward the sun’s rising.--_James Russell Lowell._


The individual who cultivates grievances, and who is perpetually
exacting explanations of his assumed wrongs, can only be ignored, and
left to the education of time and of development.... One does not argue
or contend with the foul miasma that settles over stagnant water; one
leaves it and climbs to a higher region, where the air is pure and the
sunshine fair.--_Lilian Whiting._


“Manners must adorn knowledge, and smooth its way through the world.”


Let not future things disturb thee, for thou wilt come to them if it
shall be necessary, having with thee the same reason which thou now
usest for present things.--_Marcus Aurelius._


We hear much said of “environment.” We need to realize that environment
should never be allowed to make the man, but that man should always,
and always can, condition the environment. When we realize this, we
will find that many times it is not necessary to take ourselves out of
any particular environment, because we may yet have a work to do there;
but by the very force we carry with us, we can so affect and change
matters that we will have an entirely new set of conditions in an old
environment.--_Ralph Waldo Trine._


FABLE.

  The mountain and the squirrel
  Had a quarrel,
  And the former called the latter “Little Prig”;
  Bun replied,
  “You are doubtless very big;
  But all sorts of things and weather
  Must be taken in together,
  To make up a year
  And a sphere.
  And I think it no disgrace
  To occupy my place.
  If I’m not so large as you,
  You are not so small as I,
  And not half so spry.
  I’ll not deny you make
  A very pretty squirrel track;
  Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;
  If I cannot carry forests on my back,
  Neither can you crack a nut.”
                --_Emerson._


O the paralyzing effect of fear of evil! It surely doth make “cowards
of us all.” It makes us pygmies where we might be giants, were we only
free from it.--_H. Emilie Cady._


As you grow old, guard against the tendency to live more coarsely, to
relax in your discipline. Obey your finest instincts. Be fastidious to
the extreme of sanity.--_Thoreau._


  “Then let us smile when skies are gray,
  And laugh at stormy weather,
  And sing life’s lonesome times away:
  So worry and the dreariest day
  Will find an end together.”


Character is not only written in the face, expressed in conduct and
language, but is sent forth as a thought atmosphere.--_Dresser._


                  Others shall
  Take patience, courage, to their heart and hand
  From thy hand and thy heart and thy brave cheer,
  And God’s grace fructify through thee to all.
                --_Elizabeth Barrett Browning._


To love one soul for its beauty and grace and truth is to open the
way to appreciate all beautiful and true and gracious souls, and to
recognize spiritual beauty wherever it is seen.--_H. Black._


We must alter for the better always and unceasingly. Nature seems to be
at rest only because she is perpetually renewed. The soul enjoys repose
on the same terms.--_De Ravignon._


God gives us power to bear all the sorrows of His making: but He does
not give the power to bear the sorrows of our own making, which the
anticipation of sorrow most assuredly is.--_Ian MacLaren._


  Ever laughs the sunlight in our eyes at morning and at noon,
  Comes the pure, cool wind, to whisper past our cheek its cheery tune,
  Just to tell us Earth is beautiful, and at the quiet even
  Every star looks down lest we forget that earth is crowned with
      Heaven.
                --_E. R. Sill._


“The whole world unites in pushing us the way we have really made up
our mind to go.”


Without distinction, without calculation, without procrastination,
love. Lavish it upon the poor, where it is very easy; especially
upon the rich, who often need it most; most of all upon our equals,
where it is very difficult, and for whom perhaps we each do least of
all.--_Henry Drummond._


  Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute!
  What you can do, or think you can, begin it!
                --_Goethe._


’Tis better to live rich than to die rich.--_Dr. Johnson._


It seems to me there is no maxim for a noble life like this: Count
always your highest moments your truest moments. Believe that in the
time when you were the greatest and most spiritual man, then you were
your truest self.--_Phillips Brooks._


Fine society is the graceful, genial, sympathetic intercourse of fine
souls.--_Lilian Whiting._


The stream of content must flow from ourselves, taking its source
from a deliberate disposition to learn what is good, and a determined
resolution to seek for and enjoy it, however small the portion may
be.--_Zimmermann._


When you have a number of disagreeable duties to perform, always do the
most disagreeable first.--_Josiah Quincy._


God says, live deeply, earnestly in the present, and the spirit of all
the ages shall come and reveal itself to you.--_Phillips Brooks._


To try too hard to make people good is one way to make them worse. The
only way to make them good, is to be good, remembering well the beam
and the mote.--_George Macdonald._


  “Ask God to give thee skill
    For comfort’s art,
  That thou may’st consecrated be,
    And set apart
  Unto a life of sympathy!
  For comforters are needed much
    Of Christ-like touch.”


  For he that wrongs his friend
  Wrongs himself more, and ever bears about
  A silent court of justice in his breast,
  Himself the judge and jury, and himself
  The prisoner at the bar, ever condemned.
                --_Tennyson._


The sense of humor is the oil of life’s engine. Without it, the
machinery creaks and groans. No lot is so hard, no aspect of things is
so grim, but it relaxes before a hearty laugh.--_G. S. Merriam._


  The happiest heart that ever beat
    Was in some quiet breast,
  That found the common daylight sweet
    And left to Heaven the rest.
                --_John Vance Cheney._


“Of all work,” said the Bishop of Exeter, “that produces results,
nine-tenths must be drudgery. There is no work, from the highest to the
lowest, which can be done well by any man who is unwilling to make that
sacrifice.”


It is a hard thing to close up a discourse and to cut it short, when
you are once in, and have a great deal more to say. There is nothing
wherein the strength and breeding of a horse is so much seen as in a
round, graceful, and sudden stop.--_Montaigne._


  Greatly begin! though thou have time
  But for a line, be that sublime--
  Not failure, but low aim, is crime.
                --_James Russell Lowell._


Can anything be sadder than work left unfinished? Yes; work never
begun.--_Christina Rossetti._


When we feel a strong desire to thrust our advice on others, it is
usually because we suspect their weakness; but we ought rather to
suspect our own.--_Colton._


Sorrow is the mere rust of the soul. Activity will cleanse and brighten
it.--_Dr. Johnson._


Efforts to be permanently useful, must be uniformly joyous--a
spirit all sunshine--graceful from very gladness, beautiful because
bright.--_Carlyle._


Read the philosophers, and learn how to make life happy; seeking useful
precepts and brave and noble words which may become deeds.--_Seneca._


  “I pray the prayer of Pluto old;
    God make thee beautiful within,
  And let thine eye the good behold
    In everything save sin.”


Nothing is so strong as gentleness, nothing so gentle as real
strength.--_St. Francis de Sales._


  Oh! square thyself for use; a stone that may
  Fit in the wall is left not in the way.
                --_R. C. French._


The best piece of good fortune which can come to one is opportunity
for intimacy with a leader, in whatever line of life he may be
engaged.--_Edward Everett Hale._


God has delivered yourself to your care, and says: “I had no fitter to
trust than you.”--_Epictetus._


  I gazed on the throng of hurrying faces,
  Some in tatters and some in laces,
  And I said to myself, “How will it be,
  When the soul of each is at last set free?”

  For she who is plainest and most forlorn,
  May, by her beauty, God’s heaven adorn;
  While she who is fairest of form and face,
  May, near God’s beautiful, look out of place.

  So I said, “How, my soul, will it be with thee?”--_Laura Barker._


Half the world is on the wrong scent in the pursuit of happiness. They
think it consists in having and getting, and in being served by others.
It consists in giving and in serving others.--_Henry Drummond._


What we like determines what we are, and is the sign of what we are;
and to teach taste is inevitably to form character.--_Ruskin._


  One feast of holy days the crest
    I, though no Churchman, love to keep;
  All-Saints--the unknown good that rest
    In God’s still memory folded deep.
                --_Lowell._


Doing nothing for others is the undoing of ourselves.--_Horace Mann._


Of nothing may we be more sure than this, that if we cannot sanctify
our present lot, we could sanctify no other. Our heaven and our
Almighty Father are there or nowhere.--_Dr. James Martineau._


“Whether in large or small affairs, there must be perpetual adjustment.
Neither men nor women, more than our finely strung musical instruments,
can escape the need of constant tuning.”


As nothing reveals character like the company we like and keep,
so nothing foretells futurity like the thoughts over which we
brood.--_Newell Dwight Hillis._


Simply do the best you know, then trust. He who seeks to live by
the Spirit and who cares above all for that, will not be without
guidance.--_Horatio W. Dresser._


  Though to-day may not fulfill
  All thy hopes, have patience still;
  For perchance to-morrow’s sun
  Sees thy happier day begun.
                --_P. Gerhardt._


  There are beautiful things far out in the years:
  Can we not bear bravely some burdens and fears?
                --_From Dream Land Sent, Lilian Whiting._


                 The years
  Have taught some sweet, some bitter lessons, none
  Wiser than this, to spend in all things else,
  But of old friends to be most miserly.
                --_Lowell._


“It is better to endure all the frowns and anger of the greatest on
earth, than to have an uneasy conscience within our breast. O, let the
bird in the soul be always kept singing whatsoever one may suffer.”


The men and women that are lifting the world upward and onward are
those who encourage more than criticise.--_Elizabeth Harrison._


I ought not to pronounce judgment on a fellow creature until I know
all that enters into his life; until I can measure all the forces of
temptation and resistance; until I can give full weight to all the
facts in the case. In other words, I am never in a position to judge
another.--_Hamilton W. Mabie._


What I am thinking and doing day by day is resistlessly shaping my
future--a future in which there is no expiation except through my own
better conduct. No one can save me. No one can live my life for me. If
I am wise I shall begin to-day to build my own truer and better world
from within.--_H. W. Dresser._


I am an enemy to long explanation; they deceive either the maker or the
hearer, generally both.--_Goethe._


He who is false to present duty, breaks a thread in the loom, and
will find a flaw, when he may have forgotten the cause.--_Henry Ward
Beecher._


“When the outlook is not good, try the uplook.”


Every advance we make toward the realization of the truth of the
permanence and immanence of law, brings us nearer to Him, who is the
First Cause of all law and all phenomena.--_David Starr Jordan._


  When in the mid-day march we meet
    The outstretched shadows of the night,
  The promise, how divinely sweet,
    “At eventide, it shall be light.”
                --_Alice Cary._


You are never to complain of your birth, your training, your
employments, your hardships; never to fancy that you could be
something if only you had a different lot and sphere assigned you.
God understands his own plan, and He knows what you want a great deal
better than you do yourself.--_H. Bushnell._


  Soar on and up, it’s God projecting as it goes,
  Expanding into love and joy and peace--but not repose.
                --_W. W. Story._


“If you would have a happy family life, remember two things: in matters
of principle, stand like a rock; in matters of taste, swim with the
current.”


Learn not only by a comet’s rush, but by a rose’s blush.--_Browning._


When the Kingdom is once found, life ceases to be a plodding, and
becomes an exaltation, an ecstasy, a joy.--_R. W. Trine._


Immortality will come to such as are fit for it; and he who would be a
great soul in the future must be a great soul now.--_Emerson._


There is no kind of bondage which life lays upon us that may not yield
both sweetness and strength; and nothing reveals a man’s character more
fully than the spirit in which he bears his limitations.--_Hamilton W.
Mabie._


The vision of things to be done may come a long time before the
way of doing them appears clear. But woe to him who distrusts the
vision.--_Jenkin Lloyd Jones._


  “Every day is a fresh beginning,
    Listen, my soul, to the glad refrain;
  And, spite of old sorrow and older sinning,
    Take heart with the day and begin again.”


In order to manage children well, we must borrow their eyes and their
hearts, see and feel as they do, and judge them from their own point of
view.

I pray God to make parents reasonable.--_Eugenie de Guerin._


The finest culture comes from the study of men in their best
moods.--_Plutarch._


Far away there in the sunshine are my highest aspirations; I cannot
reach them, but I can look up and see their beauty, believe in them,
and try to follow where they lead.--_Louisa May Alcott._


No power in society, no hardship in your condition can depress you,
keep you down, in knowledge, power, virtue, influence, but by your own
consent.--_Channing._


Contentment comes neither by culture nor by wishing; it is
reconciliation with our lot, growing out of an inward superiority to
our surroundings.--_Rev. J. K. McLean._


At times it is only necessary to rest one’s self in silence for a few
minutes, in order to take off the pressure and become wonderfully
refreshed.--_Dresser._


Touchiness, when it becomes chronic, is a morbid condition of the
inward disposition.

It is self-love inflamed to the acute point.--_Drummond._


It is not written, blessed is he that feedeth the poor, but he that
considereth the poor. A little thought and a little kindness are often
worth more than a great deal of money.--_Ruskin._


  For life, with all its yields of joy and woe
    And hope and fear,--believe the aged friend,--
  Is just our chance o’ the prize of learning love;
    How love might be, hath been indeed, and is;
  And that we hold henceforth to the uttermost
    Such prize despite the envy of the world,
  And having gained truth, keep truth, that is all.
                --_Robert Browning._


Oh, do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men! Do not pray
for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks!
Then the doing of your work shall be no miracle. But you shall be a
miracle. Every day you shall wonder at yourself, at the richness of
life which has come in you by the grace of God.--_Phillips Brooks._


What does your anxiety do? It does not empty to-morrow, brother, of its
sorrow; but ah! it empties to-day of its strength. It does not make you
escape the evil; it makes you unfit to cope with it if it comes.--_Ian
MacLaren._


If you wish to be miserable, think about yourself, about what you want,
what you like, what respect people ought to pay you; and then to you
nothing will be pure. You will spoil everything you touch, you will
make misery for yourself out of everything which God sends you: you
will be as wretched as you choose.--_Charles Kingsley._


  But on God’s dial-plate of time,
    ’Tis never late to him who stands
  Self-centred in a trust sublime,
    With mastered force and thinking hands.
                --_Minot J. Savage._


“Look for the light that the shadow proves.”


  Oh, the little birds sang East,
    and the little birds sang West,
  And I smiled to think God’s
    greatness flowed around our incompleteness,
  Round our restlessness, His rest.--_E. B. Browning._


  Be thrifty, but not covetous: therefore give
  Thy need, thine honor, and thy friend his due.
  Never was scraper brave man. Get to live;
  Then live, and use it: else it is not true
    That thou hast gotten. Surely use alone
    Makes money not a contemptible stone.
                --_George Herbert._


  “I do not deem that it matters not
    How you live your life below;
  It matters much to the heedless crowd
    That you see go to and fro;
  For all that is noble and high and good
    Has an influence on the rest,
  And the world is better for everyone
    Who is living at his best.”


Let us beware of losing our enthusiasm. Let us ever glory in something,
and strive to attain our admiration for all that would ennoble, and our
interest in all that would enrich and beautify our life.--_Phillips
Brooks._


A high purpose is magnetic and attracts rich resources.--_Lilian
Whiting._


  Be firm: one certain element in luck
  Is genuine, solid old Teutonic pluck.
                --_Oliver Wendell Holmes._


Not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more
difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting
moment.--_George Augustus Sala._


It is astonishing what a lot of odd minutes one can catch during the
day, if one really sets about it.--_Dinah Maria Mulock._


  So I will trudge with heart elate,
    And feet with courage shod,
  For that which men call chance and fate
    Is the handiwork of God.
                --_Alice Cary._


  “This world is a difficult world indeed,
    And people are hard to suit,
  And the man who plays on the violin
    Is a bore to the man with a flute.”


No man can be provident of his time who is not prudent in the choice of
his company.--_Jeremy Taylor._


Every great man is always being helped by everybody; for his gift is to
get good out of all things and all persons.--_Ruskin._


Belief in compensation, or that nothing is got for nothing,
characterizes all valuable minds.--_Emerson._


Never shrink from anything which your business calls you to do. The
man who is above his business may one day find his business above
him.--_Drew._


  The common problem, yours, mine, every one’s,
  Is not to fancy what were fair in life,
  Provided it could be--but finding first
  What may be, then find how to make it fair
  Up to our means.
                --_Browning._


Every life that has God in it has the index to character and the key to
the highest attainment.--_L. Purington._


Be resolutely and faithfully what you are; be humbly what you aspire
to be. Man’s noblest gift to man is his sincerity, for it embraces his
integrity also.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


We often do more good by our sympathy than by our labors.--_Canon
Farrar._


Dost thou love life? Then waste not time; for time is the stuff that
life is made of.--_Benjamin Franklin._


The best way of training the young, is to train yourself at the same
time; not to admonish them, but to be seen always doing that of which
you would admonish them.--_Plato._


It is a good and safe rule to sojourn in every place, as if you meant
to spend your life there, never omitting an opportunity of doing a
kindness, or speaking a true word, or making a friend.--_Ruskin._


Landor’s definition of a great man: He who can call together the most
select company when it pleases him.


We go apart to get still; that new life, new inspiration, new power of
thought, new supplies from the Fountainhead, may flow in.--_H. Emilie
Cady._


Perhaps it is a good thing to have an unsound hobby ridden hard; for it
is sooner ridden to death.--_Charles Dickens._


  “Take a dash of water cold
    And a little leaven of prayer,
  A little bit of sunshine gold
    Dissolved in the morning air;
  Add to your meal some merriment
    And a thought for kith and kin;
  And then, as a prime ingredient
    A plenty of work thrown in:
  But spice it all with the essence of love
    And a little whiff of play:
  Let a wise old book and a glance above
    Complete a well spent day.”


Judge not thy friend until thou standest in his place.--_Rabbi Hillel._


“He who is always inquiring what people will say, will never give them
opportunity to say anything great about him.”


Borrowing is the canker and the death of every man’s estate.--_Sir
Walter Raleigh._


It is not so much what you say to the children that charges the
atmosphere of your home, as it is the spirit of your life, the temper
you exhibit, the ends which you live for.--_Dr. J. K. McLean._


Punishment closely follows sin, it being born at the same time with it.
Whoever expects punishment, already suffers it; whoever has deserved
it, expects it.--_Montaigne._


I hope I shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what
I consider the most enviable of all titles, that of an “Honest
Man.”--_George Washington._


Trust in God, as Moses did, let the way be never so dark; and it shall
come to pass that your life at last shall surpass even your longing.
Not, it may be, in the line of that longing; that shall be as it
pleaseth God; but the glory is as sure as the grace, and the most
ancient heavens are not more sure than that.--_Robert Collyer._


Men suffer all their life long under the foolish superstition that
they can be cheated. But it is as impossible for a man to be cheated
by anyone but himself, as for a thing to be and not to be at the same
time. There is a third silent party to all our bargains. The nature
and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment of
every contract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If you
serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God in your debt.
Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer the payment is withholden, the
better for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate
and usage of this exchequer.--_Emerson._


I believe if we could only see beforehand what it is that our Heavenly
Father means us to be, the soul beauty and perfection and glory, the
glorious and lovely spiritual body that this soul is to dwell in
through all eternity, if we could have a glimpse of this, we should not
grudge all the trouble and pains he is taking with us now to bring us
up to that ideal which is his thought of us.--_Annie Keary._


Let thy every word and act be perfect truth, uttered in genuine love.
Let not the forms of business, or the conventional arrangements of
society reduce thee into falsehood. Be true to thyself. Be true to thy
friend. Be true to the world.--_Lydia Maria Child._


Infidelity to self is infidelity to God.--_Charles B. Newcomb._


Learn to handle and control the ignorant part of your being as you
would watch and guide a child. Hold thought and expression to your
highest ideal. Learn from your failure.--_God’s Light as It Came to Me._


Self reliance is the basis of behavior, as it is the guaranty that the
powers are not squandered in too much demonstration.--_Emerson._


  For not in far-off realms of space
  The Spirit hath its throne;
  In every heart it findeth place
  And waiteth to be known.
                --_F. L. Hosmer._


Difficulties may surround our path; but if the difficulties be not in
ourselves, they may generally be overcome.--_Prof. Jowett._


Life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little
things, in which smiles and kindnesses and small obligations,
given habitually, are what win and preserve the heart and secure
comfort.--_Sir Humphrey Davy._


  He that respects himself is safe from others;
  He wears a coat of mail that none can pierce.
                --_Longfellow._


Chilo, having had the question put to him, What is difficult? said: “To
be silent about secrets; to make good use of one’s leisure; and to be
able to submit to injustice.”


We should every day call ourselves to an account. What infirmity have I
mastered to-day? What temptation have I resisted? What virtue acquired?
Our vices will abate of themselves if they be brought every day to the
shrift.--_Seneca._


  Life is something, while the senses heed
        The spirit’s call;
  Life is nothing, when our grosser need
        Engulfs it all.
                --_Julia Ward Howe._


The true spirit of conversation consists in building on another man’s
observation, not overturning it.--_Bulwer._


_Revery is the Sunday of thought_; and who knows which is the more
important and fruitful for man, the laborious tension of the week, or
the life-giving repose of the Sabbath?--_Amiel’s Journal._


There is nothing ridiculous in seeming to be what you really are, but a
good deal in affecting to be what you are not.--_Sir J. Lubbock._


  In life’s small things be resolute and great
  To keep thy muscles trained: knowest thou when Fate
  Thy measure takes, or when she’ll say to thee,
  “I find thee worthy, do this thing for me?”
                --_Lowell._


  If I can stop one heart from breaking,
    I shall not live in vain.
  If I can ease one life the aching,
    Or cool one pain,
  Or help one fainting robin
    Unto his nest again,
  I shall not live in vain.
                --_Emily Dickinson._


I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of a
man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. It is something to be
able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so make a
few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint
the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we
can do.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


Much which we think essential is merely a matter of habit.--_Thomas
Wentworth Higginson._


The royal road to success is to obey the inner genius, to act in
accordance with one’s own intuition, regardless of the fear or favor of
those who are bound to the wheel of conventional consistency.--_Lilian
Whiting._


Act well at the moment, and you have performed a good action for all
eternity.--_Lavater._


  New occasions teach new duties;
    Time makes ancient good uncouth;
  They must upward still, and onward,
    Who would keep abreast of truth.
                --_James Russell Lowell._


What do we live for if it is not to make life less difficult to each
other?--_George Eliot._


Good to forgive, best to forget.--_Browning._


What reason have we to think any other station in the universe more
sanctifying than our own? There is none, so far as we can tell, under
the more immediate touch of God, none whence sublimer deeps are open to
adoration, none murmuring with the whisper of more thrilling affections
or ennobled as the theater of more glorious duties. Those to whom the
earth is not consecrated will find their heaven profane.--_Dr. James
Martineau._


Whoever can influence men should strive to make them more courageous,
more enduring, more hopeful, simpler, more joyful.--_Bishop Spaulding._


It is our part in life to work with all our strength toward the
realization of ideal humanity, to add one more link to the chain which
joins the man-brute of the past, through the man of the present, to the
man of the future. The man who is likest Him, we have chosen for our
ideal.--_David Starr Jordan._


My own experience and development deepens every day my conviction that
our moral progress may be measured by the degree in which we sympathize
with individual suffering and individual joy.--_George Eliot._


“When opposition of any kind is necessary, drop all color of emotion
out of it and let it be seen in the white light of truth.”


The true use of a man’s possessions is to help his work, and the
best end of all his work is to show us what he is. The noblest
workers of our world bequeath us nothing so great as the image of
themselves.--_James Martineau._


“What is the secret of your life?” asked Mrs. Browning of Charles
Kingsley; “tell me, that I may make mine beautiful too?” He replied, “I
had a friend.”--_William C. Gannett._


Better make penitents by gentleness than hypocrites by severity.--_St.
Francis de Sales._


Wondrous is the strength of cheerfulness; altogether past calculation
its powers of endurance.--_Carlyle._


Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond
records, that youth and observation copied there; and thy commandment
all along shall live within the book and volume of my brain, unmixed
with baser matter.--_Shakespeare._


I am surprised that intelligent men do not see the immense value of
good temper in their homes; and am amazed that they will take such
pains to have costly houses and fine furniture, and yet sometimes
neglect to bring home with them good temper.--_Theodore Parker._


Everyone should consider his body as a priceless gift from one whom he
loves above all, a marvelous work of art, of indescribable beauty, and
mastery beyond human conception, and so delicate that a word, a breath,
a look, nay, a thought may injure it.--_Nikola Tesla._


  Beware of desperate steps; the darkest day,
  Lived till to-morrow, will have passed away.
                --_Cowper._


Education should be full of feeling. It takes sunlight to draw out
the fragrance of the violet and the perfume of the rose.--_Ellen A.
Richardson._


We are encompassed about by the forces that make for righteousness. All
power we possess, or seem to possess, comes from our accord with these
forces. There is no lasting force, except the power of God.--_David
Starr Jordan._


If one admires the patience, gentleness, sweetness and unfailing energy
of another; if he finds himself renewed and invigorated and inspired by
such contact,--why does he not himself so live that he may bring the
same renewal and inspiration to others?--_Lilian Whiting._


  The flighty purpose never is o’ertook
  Unless the deed go with it.
                --_Shakespeare._


Characters are determined not by the opinions which we profess, but by
those on which our thoughts habitually fasten, which recur to them most
forcibly and which color our ordinary views of God and duty.--_William
Ellery Channing._


We are too busy, too encumbered, too much occupied, too active! We
read too much! The one thing needful is to throw off all one’s load of
cares, and to become young again, living happily and gracefully in the
present hour. We must know how to put occupation aside, which does not
mean that we must be idle.--_Translation, Mrs. Humphry Ward._


The new conditions of life demand the higher spirituality of the
individual. But what is this? Is it a name, a mental state of
exaltation, an ecstasy? Is it an exalted hour, or is it conduct? Is it
a merely theoretical thing, a vision caught in some rare hour?... If it
be thus, it may have a decorative value in ethics, but is devoid of any
practical bearing on our common life. Unless spirituality is the power
that transforms falsehood to truth, selfishness to generosity, unless
it enters into character as a pervasive force, of what use can it be?

Spirituality is not negative. It is not the mere absence of sin. It is
the most positive state.--_The World Beautiful, Lilian Whiting._


  The world seemed empty, and black, and cold,
  And wretched, and helpless, and very old.
  God gave me a thought; a new world grew,
  The thought created the world anew.
                --_S. W. Foss._


Apology is only egotism wrong side out.--_Oliver Wendell Holmes._


No one has any more right to go about unhappy than he has to go about
ill-bred. He owes it to himself, to his friends, to society and the
community in general, to live up to his best spiritual possibilities,
not only now and then, but every day and every hour.--_Lilian Whiting._


Who shoots at the mid-day sun, though he be sure that he shall never
hit the mark, yet as sure is he that he shall shoot higher than he who
aims but at a bush.--_Sir Philip Sidney._


Blessed are they who have the gift of making friends, for it is one of
God’s best gifts. It involves many things, but, above all, the power of
going out of one’s self, and seeing and appreciating whatever is noble
and loving in another.--_Thomas Hughes._


There is no duty the fulfillment of which will not make you happier,
nor any temptation for which there is no remedy.--_Seneca._


Let nothing come between you and the light.--_Henry D. Thoreau._


  “The summer vanishes, but soon shall come
  The glad young days of yet another year.
  So do not mourn the passing of a joy,
  But rather wait the coming of a good,
  And know God never takes a gift away
  But He sends other gifts to take its place.”


We must be as courteous to a man as to a picture, which we are willing
to give the benefit of a good light.--_Emerson._


The old year is fast slipping back behind us. We cannot stay it if
we would. We must go on and leave our past. Let us go forth nobly.
Let us go as those whom greater thoughts and greater deeds await
beyond.--_Phillips Brooks._


Opportunity is a good angel, but she deserts those who fail to
recognize her. The ring of power must be worn; ... if the charm is not
held to service, it slips away.--_Lilian Whiting._


A dull day need not be a depressing day; depression always implies
physical or moral weakness, and is therefore never to be tolerated so
long as one can struggle against it.--_Hamilton W. Mabie._


  ’Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours
  And ask them what report they bore to heaven.
                --_Young’s Night Thoughts._


For the will and not the gift makes the giver.--_Lessing._


Write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the
year.--_Emerson._


If I shoot at the sun I may hit a star.--_P. T. Barnum._


The highest point of achievement of yesterday is the starting point of
to-day.--_Motto of Paulist Fathers._


I look upon that man as happy, who, when there is a question of
success, looks into his work for a reply; not into the market, not into
opinion, not into patronage. Work is victory. You want but one verdict;
if you have your own, you are secure of the rest.--_Emerson._


  There is ever a song somewhere, my dear,
  Be the skies above or dark or fair,
  There is ever a song that our hearts may hear--
  There is ever a song somewhere, my dear--
  There is ever a song somewhere!
                --_James Whitcomb Riley._


  “The Present, the Present is all thou hast
    For thy sure possessing;
  Like the Patriarch’s angel, hold it fast
    Till it gives its blessing.”


What a sublime doctrine it is that goodness cherished _now_, is eternal
life already entered upon!--_William Ellery Channing._


  He who feels contempt
  For any living thing, hath faculties
  That he has never used:
  And thought with him
  Is in its infancy.
                --_Phillips Brooks._


“‘This one thing I do,’ or, ‘These forty things I dabble in,’--which
shall it be?”


I expect to pass through this life but once. If, therefore, there is
any kindness I can show, or any good I can do to any fellow-being,
let me do it now, let me not defer it, for I shall not pass this way
again.--_Mrs. A. B. Hegeman._


We get no good by being ungenerous, even to a book.--_E. B. Browning._


  Build a little fence of trust around to-day,
  Fill the space with loving deeds and therein stay;
  Look not through the sheltering bars upon to-morrow,
  God will help thee bear what comes of joy or sorrow.
                --_Mary Frances Butts._


A wide-spreading, hopeful disposition is the best umbrella for this
vale of tears.--_Wm. D. Howells._


He who meets life as though it meant something worth finding out, and
who expresses his best self, is the one who has the permanent basis of
happiness.--_H. W. Dresser._


Conscience is nothing else but the echo of God’s voice within the
soul.--_E. B. Hall._


We prepare ourselves for sudden deeds by the reiterated choice of good
or evil, that gradually determines character.--_George Eliot._


To be courteous to one’s peers is all very well, but it is fairness and
courtesy and consideration to those in dependent or limited conditions
that constitute the true test of the gentleman or lady.--_Lilian
Whiting._


I like not only to be loved, but to be told I am loved. The realm of
silence is large enough beyond the grave.--_George Eliot._


I should count myself fortunate if my home were remembered
for some inspiring quality of faith, charity, and aspiring
intelligence.--_Hamilton W. Mabie._


  How soon a smile of God can change the world!
  How we are made for happiness--how work
  Grows play, adversity a winning fight!
                --_Browning._


  Let this auspicious morning be expressed
  With a white stone distinguished from the rest,
  White as thy fame, and as thy honor clear,
  And let new joys attend on thy now added year.
                --_Dryden._


Give to a gracious message a host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
themselves.--_Shakespeare._


  Still o’er the earth hastes Opportunity,
  Seeking the hardy soul that seeks for her.
  Be not abroad, nor deaf with household cares
  That chatter loudest as they mean the least;
  Swift-willed is thrice willed; late means nevermore;
  Impatient is her foot, nor turns again.
                --_James Russell Lowell._


To live content with small means--to seek elegance rather than luxury,
and refinement rather than fashion, to be worthy not respectable,
and wealthy not rich--to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act
frankly, to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open
heart--to bear all cheerfully--do all bravely, await occasions--never
hurry; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow
up through the common. This is to be my symphony.--_William Ellery
Channing._


Let us do our duty in our shop or our kitchen, the market, the street,
the office, the school, the home, just as faithfully as if we stood
in the front rank of some great battle, and we knew that victory for
mankind depended on our bravery, strength, and skill. When we do that,
the humblest of us will be serving in that great army which achieves
the welfare of the world.--_Theodore Parker._


Opportunities correspond with almost mathematical accuracy to the
ability for using them.--_Lilian Whiting._


The blessedness of life depends more upon its interests than upon its
comforts.--_George Macdonald._


No man finds himself until he has created a world for his own soul;
a world apart from care and weakness and the confusion of strife, in
which the faiths that inspire him, and the ideals that lead him are the
great and lasting verities.--_Hamilton W. Mabie._


Endeavor to be patient in bearing the defects and infirmities of
others, of what sort soever they be; for thou thyself also hast many
failings which must be borne with by others.--_Thomas à Kempis._


He who does a good deed is instantly ennobled. He who does a mean deed
is by the action itself contracted. He who puts off impurity thereby
puts on purity.--_Emerson._


They also serve who only stand and wait.--_Milton._


He that is choice of his time will be choice of his company and choice
of his actions.--_Jeremy Taylor._


In all things throughout the world, the man who looks for the crooked
will see the crooked, and the man who looks for the straight will see
the straight.--_Ruskin._


Begin, live, aspire, realize the best ideal of the moment; and this
earnest effort shall lead the way to greater achievement.--_H. W.
Dresser._


Music is a moral law. It gives a soul to the universe, wings to the
mind, flight to the imagination, a charm to sadness, gayety and life to
everything. It is the essence of order, and leads to all that is good,
just, and beautiful.--_Plato._


  If thou wouldst speak a word of loving cheer,
  Oh, speak it now. This moment is thine own.
                --_Nellie M. Richardson._


Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential
converse?--_Plato._


If a man can write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a
better mouse-trap, than his neighbor, though he builds his house in the
woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door.--_Emerson._


Come, let us live the poetry we sing.--_Edwin Markham._


“Instead of wishing that all men were of our mind, we should account it
one of the first blessings of life that there are men who do not agree
with us. The currents of sea and air are not more necessary than the
currents of thought.”


In looking back over our lives, we often see that what seemed at the
time the worst hours and the most hopeless in their wretchedness
were in reality the best of all! They developed powers within us
that had heretofore slept; developed energies of which we had never
dreamed.--_James Freeman Clarke._


Let your task be to render yourself worthy of love, and this even
more for your own happiness than for that of another’s.--_Maurice
Materlinck._


There is great danger in constant dissatisfaction. Sooner or later,
it will involve the health, or finances, or both, for it destroys the
mental balance, and impairs the judgment.--_C. B. Newcomb._


“Don’t nurse opportunity too long--take it into active partnership with
you at once, lest it leave you for other company.”


  We just shake hands at meeting
    With many that come nigh;
  We nod the head in greeting
    To many that go by,--
  But welcome through the gateway
    Our few old friends and true;
  Then hearts leap up, and straightway
    There’s open house for you,
  Old Friends, there’s open house for you!

  The surface will be sparkling,
    Let but a sunbeam shine;
  Yet in the deep lies darkling,
    The true life of the wine!
  The froth is for the many,
    The wine is for the few;
  Unseen, untoucht of any,
    We keep the best for you,
  Old Friends, the very best for you!

  The many cannot know us;
    They only pace the strand,
  Where at our worst we show us--
  The waters thick with sand!
  But out beyond the leaping
    Dim surge ’tis clear and blue;
  And there, Old Friends, we are keeping
    A sacred calm for you,
  Old Friends, a waiting calm for you.--_Gerald Massey._


It is my custom every night to run all over the words and actions of
the past day; for why should I fear the sight of my errors when I can
admonish and forgive myself? I was a little too hot in such a dispute:
my opinion might have been as well spared, for it gave offense, and did
no good at all. The thing was true; but all truths are not to be spoken
at all times.--_Seneca._


  Also, I think that good must come of good,
  And ill of evil--surely--unto all--
  In every place and time--seeing sweet fruit
  Groweth from wholesome roots, and bitter things
  From poison stocks; yea, seeing, too, how spite
  Breeds hate, and kindness, friends, and patience, peace.
                --_Edwin Arnold._


If we would listen intently, we might hear the divine voice within,
assuring us that God is our life; that spirit is the only substantial
entity and that love is the only law.--_Henry Wood._


Let us grow out of the idea that because we do some one a favor or
render him a service, that he is thereby under some transcendent
obligation to us. Let us recognize the truth--that it is we who are
obliged if he will permit us to do him a favor.--_Lilian Whiting._


Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to
the end dare to do our duty as we understand it.--_Abraham Lincoln._


Compass happiness, since happiness alone is victory. What you make of
life, it will be to you. Take it up bravely, bear it on joyfully, lay
it down triumphantly.--_Gail Hamilton._


Those things that are not practicable are not desirable. There is
nothing that God has judged good for us that He has not given us
the means to accomplish. If we cry like children for the moon, like
children we must cry on.--_Burke._


  I feel the earth move sunward,
  I join the great march onward,
  And take by faith while living
  My freehold of thanksgiving.
                --_John G. Whittier._


  Howe’er it be, it seems to me
    ’Tis only noble to be good;
  Kind hearts are more than coronets,
    And simple faith than Norman blood.
                --_Tennyson._


Pin thy faith to no man’s sleeve; hast thou not two eyes of thine
own?--_Carlyle._


Do your best loyally and cheerfully, and suffer yourself to feel no
anxiety nor fear. Your times are in God’s hands. He has assigned you
your place: He will direct your paths; He will accept your efforts, if
they be faithful.--_Canon Farrar._


When we cease to look upon any experience as too hard, we have made a
decided step in wise adjustment to life.--_H. W. Dresser._


A certain awkwardness marks the use of borrowed thoughts, but as
soon as we have learned what to do with them, they become our
own.--_Emerson._


The choir invisible! Who are members of it, if not all those who in any
way are doing the day’s work, whatever it may be, as well as they know
how; who are trying to make the world happier and pleasanter for those
to whom their lives are naturally bound.--_John White Chadwick._


  “By thine own soul’s law learn to live,
    And if men scorn thee, take no care,
  And if men hate thee, take no heed,
  But sing thy song and do thy deed,
    And hope thy hope, and pray thy prayer.”


There are some who want to get rid of their past, who, if they could,
would begin all over again, ... but you must learn, you must let God
teach you, that the only way to get rid of your past is to get a future
out of it.--_Phillips Brooks._


It is a sign that your reputation is small and sinking, if your own
tongue must praise you.--_Sir Matthew Hale._


  Because a man has shop to mind
  In time and place, since flesh must live,
  Needs spirit lack all life behind,
  All stray thoughts, fancies fugitive,
  All loves except what trade can give?
                --_Browning._


There is no beautifier in form or behavior like the wish to scatter
joy, and not pain, around us.--_Emerson._


Beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great
ship.--_Benjamin Franklin._


First make your arrangements, then trust in heaven; and in no case
worry.--_Prof. Jowett._


“Hold thy peace or say something better than silence.”


“Friend, all the world’s a little queer, excepting thee and me; and
sometimes I think thee a trifle peculiar.”


We live by our enthusiasm and our exaltations. Our sympathies are our
strength. Our interests are our magnetisms, and are transmuted into our
working capital.--_Lilian Whiting._


His heart was as great as the world, but there was no room in it to
hold the memory of a wrong. (_Said of Lincoln._)--_Emerson._


He is all truth in his words, and justice in his actions, and if the
whole world should disbelieve his integrity, dispute his character, and
question his happiness, he would neither take it ill in the least, nor
turn aside from that path that leads to the aim of life, toward which
he must move, pure, calm, well prepared--and with perfect resignation
in his fate.--_Marcus Aurelius._


Observe good faith and justice toward all nations, cultivate peace and
harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it
be that good policy does not equally enjoin it?--_Washington._


It is well to believe that there needs but a little more thought,
a little more courage, more love, more devotion to life, a little
more eagerness, one day to fling open wide the portals of joy and of
truth.--_Maurice Materlinck._


  The mind has a thousand eyes,
    And the heart but one;
  Yet the light of a whole life dies
    When love is done.
                --_F. W. Bourdillon._


A man’s home is his castle, but it ought to be more. It ought to be his
home. That it is his castle is his right by law. To make it a real home
depends upon himself.--_Sir J. Lubbock._


We can fix our eyes on perfection and make almost everything speed
towards it.--_W. E. Channing._


“It was the heaven within her that made a heaven without.”


He who, forgetting self, makes the object of his life service,
helpfulness and kindness to others, finds his whole nature growing
and expanding, himself becoming large-hearted, magnanimous,
kind, sympathetic, joyous and happy; his life becoming rich and
beautiful.--_Ralph Waldo Trine._


  “Talk happiness; the world is sad enough
  Without your woes. No path is wholly rough:
  Look for the places that are smooth and clear,
  And speak of these to rest the weary ear
  Of earth, so hurt by one continuous strain
  Of human discontent and grief and pain.”


  Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
  Lest we forget,--lest we forget!
                --_Kipling._


      This world’s no blot for us
  Nor blank; it means intensely and means good:
  To find its meaning is my meat and drink.
                --_Robert Browning._


The test of friendship is its fidelity when every charm of fortune and
environment has been swept away, and the bare, undraped character alone
remains; if love still holds steadfast, and the joy of companionship
still survives, in such an hour, the fellowship becomes a beautiful
prophecy of immortality.--_Hamilton Wright Mabie._


We lose vigor through thinking continually the same set of thoughts.
New thought is new life.--_Prentice Mulford._


No sadder proof can be given by a man of his own littleness than
disbelief in great men.--_Carlyle._


If you want knowledge, you must toil for it; if food, you must toil for
it; and if pleasure, you must toil for it. Toil is the law. Pleasure
comes through toil, and not by self-indulgence and indolence. When one
gets to love work, his life is a happy one.--_Ruskin._


  Nay, never falter; no great deed is done
    By falterers who ask for certainty.
  No good is certain but the steadfast mind,
    The undivided will to seek the good.
                --_George Eliot._


There is a class of people who are comparatively valueless to the
world because of a certain morbidness which they are pleased to call
sensitiveness. In reality it is nothing of the sort. It is self-love--a
refined variety of it, to be sure, but none the less is it the result
of a selfishly subjective state, in which they look in and not out,
and down and not up, and fail to lend a hand--not from any real
unwillingness, but because they are looking in, and do not see the
opportunity.--_Lilian Whiting._


No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of it to anyone
else.--_Dickens._


We always weaken when we exaggerate.--_La Harpe._


It is not poverty that helps a man; it is the effort by which he throws
off the yoke of poverty that enlarges the powers.--_David Starr Jordan._


“Of all bad habits, despondency is among the least respectable, and
there is no one quite so tiresome as the sad-visaged Christian who is
oppressed by the wickedness and hopelessness of the world.”


Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under the trees
on a summer’s day, listening to the murmur of water, or watching the
clouds float across the sky, is by no means waste of time.--_Sir J.
Lubbock._


There is no preservative and antiseptic, nothing that keeps one’s heart
young like sympathy, like giving one’s self with enthusiasm to some
worthy thing or cause.--_John Burroughs._


A truly concentrated life promptly rejects every thought of past or
future that would disturb its confidence in the present hour.--_C. B.
Newcomb._


A man can never be idle with safety and advantage until he has been
so trained by work that he makes his freedom more fruitful than his
toil.--_Hamilton Wright Mabie._


After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is
a solution, and the soul’s indefeasible duty is to be of good
cheer.--_Wm. R. Alger._


Be sure to live on the sunny side, and even then do not expect
the world to look bright, if you habitually wear gray-brown
glasses.--_Chas. H. Eliot._


Whenever Conscience calls a halt, it is no place for Reason to debate
the question. The way ahead is no thoroughfare.--_Charles Egbert
Craddock._


Give what you have. To some one it may be better than you dare to
think.--_Longfellow._


“If bitterness has crept into the heart in the friction of the busy
day’s unguarded moments, be sure it steals away with the setting sun.
Twilight is God’s interval for peace-making.”

It is surely better to pardon too much than to condemn too much.--_Geo.
Eliot._


“The initial need to enjoyment is not many possessions, but much
appreciation.”


Just to be good, to keep life pure from degrading elements, to make it
constantly helpful in little ways to those who are touched by it, to
keep one’s spirit always sweet and avoid all manner of petty anger and
irritability,--that is an idea as noble as it is difficult.--_Edward
Howard Griggs._


Many men owe the grandeur of their lives to their tremendous
difficulties.--_Spurgeon._


  “No matter how narrow your limits
  Go forth and make them broad:
  You are every one the daughter or son,
  Crown prince or princess of God.”


The best help is not to bear the troubles of others for them, but
to inspire them with courage and energy to bear their burdens for
themselves and meet the difficulties of life bravely.--_Lubbock._


Never tell evil of a man, if you do not know it for certainty, and if
you know it for a certainty, then ask yourself, “Why should I tell
it?”--_Lavater._


[Illustration: Henry Ward Beecher

_Great powers and natural gifts do not bring privileges to
their possessors so much as they bring duties._]


  Let us then labor for an inward stillness,
  An inward stillness and an inward healing;
  That perfect silence where the lips and heart
  Are still, and we no longer entertain
  Our own imperfect thoughts and vain opinions,
  But God alone speaks in us, and we wait
  In singleness of heart that we may know
  His will, and in the silence of our own spirits,
  That we may do His will, and that only.--_Longfellow._


Many persons might have attained to wisdom had they not assumed that
they already possessed it.--_Seneca._


Stagnation is death, whether it be physical or spiritual. A pool cannot
be pure and sweet unless there is an outlet as well as an inlet. Unless
you use for the service of others what God has already given you, you
will find it a long weary road to Spiritual Understanding.--_H. Emilie
Cady._


Make friends with your trials, as though you were always to live
together, and you will find that when you cease to take thought for
your own deliverance, God will take thought for you.--_Francis de
Sales._


“God will never leave you without light enough to take one step. Don’t
stop walking till the light gives out.”


We ask for long life, but ’tis deep life, or grand moments
that signify. Let the measure of time be spiritual, not
mechanical.--_Emerson._


If a man does not make new acquaintances as he advances through
life, he will soon find himself alone. A man, sir, should keep his
friendships in constant repair.--_Dr. Johnson._


“Happiness does not depend on money or leisure, or society, or even on
health; it depends on our relation to those we love.”


Life without endeavor is like entering a jewel-mine and coming out with
empty hands.--_Japanese Proverb._


Accustom yourself to master and overcome things of difficulty; for if
you observe--the left hand for want of practice is insignificant--and
not adapted to general business; yet it holds the bridle better than
the right--from constant use.--_Pliny._


Almost every moment of the day the eye is receiving impressions from
outward objects, and instantly communicating these impressions to the
soul. Thus the soul receives every day thousands of impressions, good
or bad, according to the character of the objects presented.--_Cardinal
Gibbons._


Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we
fall.--_Confucius._


Nobody has any right to find life uninteresting or unrewarding who sees
within the sphere of his own activity a wrong he can help to remedy, or
within himself an evil he can hope to overcome.--_Chas. H. Eliot._


It is as amazing as it is sad, that we go about so largely burdening
ourselves with strivings that are of no consequence, and miss the
gladness and exhilaration of living. No life is successful until it
is radiant. The King of Glory is always ready to come in. Why do we
bar the way? We cannot all live in palaces; but we can all live in the
Kingdom of Heaven, and the material luxuries of the one pale before the
glow and thrill and exaltation of the other.--_The World Beautiful,
Lilian Whiting._


  “As I walked by myself
    I talked with myself,
  And myself said this unto me:
    Make friends with thyself,
  Be true to thyself,
    And thyself thy good angel shall be.”


The prosperity of a nation depends upon the health and morals of its
citizens, and the health and morals of people depend mainly upon the
food they eat and the houses they live in. The time has come when we
must have a science of domestic economy, and it must be worked out
in the homes of our educated women. A knowledge of the elements of
chemistry and physics must be applied to the daily living.--_Ellen
Richards._


’Tis looking downward makes one dizzy.--_Browning._


Contact with nobler natures arouses the feelings of unused power and
quickens the consciousness of responsibility.--_Canon Westcott._


Diligence is the mother of good luck.--_Benjamin Franklin._


  “Diving and finding no pearl in the sea,
  Blame not the ocean, the fault is in thee.”


        A partnership with God is motherhood,
  What strength, what purity, what self-control,
  What love, what wisdom should belong to her
  Who helps God fashion an immortal soul!
                --_Mary Wood Allen._


No one but yourself can make your life beautiful, no one can be pure,
honorable and loving for you.--_J. R. Miller._


  Ah, the key of our life, that passes all wards, opens all locks,
  Is not I will, but I must, I must, I must,--and I do it.
                --_A. H. Clough._


I beg you take courage: the brave soul can mend even
disaster.--_Catherine of Russia._


Opinions are often the very death of love. Love aright and you will
come to think aright; and those who think aright, must think the same.
In the meantime, it matters nothing. The thing that does matter is that
whereto we have attained.--_Geo. Macdonald._


Would the face of nature be so serene and beautiful if man’s destiny
were not equally so?--_Thoreau._


Some men move through life as a band of music moves down the street,
flinging out pleasure on every side through the air, to every one far
and near that can listen.--_Henry Ward Beecher._


  Man is his own star; and the soul that can
  Render an honest and an upright man,
  Commands all light, all influence, all fate;
  Nothing to him falls early or too late.
  Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,
  Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.
                --_Beaumont and Fletcher._


The nearer you come into relation with a person, the more necessary do
tact and courtesy become.--_Holmes._


What your heart thinks great is great. The soul’s emphasis is always
right.--_Emerson._


        Courage, Sir,
  That makes a man or woman look their goodliest.
                --_Tennyson._


For a woman to be wise and at the same time womanly, is to wield
a tremendous influence which may be felt for good in the lives of
generations to come.--_David Starr Jordan._


We never know for what God is preparing us in his schools, for what
work on earth, for what work in the hereafter. Our business is to do
our work well in the present place, whatever that may be.--_Lyman
Abbott._


        There is no unbelief:
  Whoever plants a seed beneath the sod,
  And waits to see it push away the clod,
        Trusts in God.
                --_Bulwer-Lytton._


The world is such stuff as ideas are made of. Thought possesses all
things. But the world is not unreal. It extends infinitely beyond
our private consciousness, because it is the world of a universal
mind.--_Josiah Royce._


  In Life’s small things be resolute and great
  To keep thy muscles trained; know’st thou when fate
  Thy measure takes? or when she’ll say to thee,
  “I find thee worthy, do this thing for me!”
                --_Emerson._


To hold one’s self in readiness for opportunity, to keep the serene,
confident, hopeful, and joyful energy of mind, is to magnetize it,
and draw privileges and power toward one. The concern is not whether
opportunity will present itself, but as to whether we will be ready for
the opportunity. It comes not to doubt and denial and disbelief. It
comes to sunny expectation, eager purpose, and to noble and generous
aspiration.--_Lilian Whiting._


  Let not soft slumber close your eyes,
  Before you’ve recollected thrice
  The train of action through the day.
  Where have my feet chose out their way?
  What have I learnt, where’er I’ve been,
  From all I’ve heard, from all I’ve seen?
  What know I more that’s worth the knowing?
  What have I done that’s worth the doing?
                --_Isaac Watts._


If we neglect to exercise any talent, power, or quality, it soon falls
away from us.--_Henry Wood._


Every moment of worry weakens the soul for its daily combat.--_Anna
Robertson Brown._


  With aching hands and bleeding feet
  We dig and heap, lay stone on stone;
  We bear the burden and the heat of the long day
  And wish ’twere done.
  Not till the hour of light return
  All we have built do we discern.
                --_Matthew Arnold._


What a man is inwardly that to him will the world be outwardly: his
mood affects the very “quality of the day.”--_Bradford Torrey._


  This is my youth--its hopes and dreams
  How strange and shadowy it all seems,
      After these many years!
  Turning the pages idly, so,
  I look with smiles upon the woe,
      Upon the joy, with tears!--_Aldrich._


  It is in loving, not in being loved,
      The heart is blessed;
  It is in giving, not in seeking gifts,
      We find our quest.
  Whatever be thy longing or thy need,
      That do thou give.
  So shalt thy soul be fed, and thou, indeed,
      Shalt truly live.
                --_M. E. Russell._


  The world is a looking glass,
  Wherein ourselves are shown,--
  Kindness for kindness, cheer for cheer,
  Coldness for gloom, repulse for fear,--
  To every soul its own.
  We cannot change the world a whit,
  Only ourselves, who look in it.
                --_Susan Coolidge._


I would say to all: use your gentlest voice at home. Watch it day by
day, as a pearl of great price; for it will be worth to you in days to
come more than the best pearl hid in the sea. A kind voice is joy, like
a lark’s song, to a hearth at home. It is a light that sings as well as
shines. Train it to sweet tones now, and it will keep in tune through
life.--_Elihu Burritt._


In a world in which so many people wear the same clothes, live in the
same house, eat the same dinner, and say the same things, blessed
are the individuals who are not lost in the mob, who have their own
thoughts, and live their own lives.--_Hamilton Wright Mabie._


There are people who go about the world looking for slights and
they are necessarily miserable, for they find them at every
turn.--_Drummond._


He who has a thousand rooms sleeps in but one.--_Japanese Proverb._


Be happy, peaceful and satisfied just as you stand, having sufficient
steadiness and independence to hold your own against the eddies and
rapids about you. Apply practically that which you perceive spiritually.

Accept your position as it is, and make the very best of it till it
passes. Work with it, knowing that Infinite Wisdom is guiding you: and
so cease all anxious thought, and rest.--_God’s Light as It Came to Me._


  Aspire, break bounds! I say,
  Endeavor to be good, and better still,
  And best!
                --_Robert Browning._


CHRISTMAS DAY.

Glory be to Thee in the highest heavens, O Thou God of our salvation.
Thou hast proclaimed peace on earth and infinite good will to men.
Unto us has been born a Guide and Deliverer. We hail the morning which
commemorates His birth. We thank Thee that we may unite in the joyful
commemoration which makes us one with millions of Thy children in all
parts of the world.--_Altar at Home._


Lift up yourselves to the great meaning of the day, and dare to think
of your humanity as something so divinely precious that it is worthy of
being an offering to God. Count it a privilege to make that offering
as complete as possible, keeping nothing back, and then go out to the
pleasures and duties of your life, having been born anew into His
divinity, as He was born into our humanity on Christmas Day.--_Phillips
Brooks._


  Then wisely weigh
  Our sorrow with our comfort.
                --_Shakespeare._


There are two times in a man’s life when he should not speculate; when
he can’t afford it, and when he can.--_Mark Twain._


A man may get to his journey’s end by the light of a lantern, but he
is less secure than the man who travels by daylight, and he loses the
landscape.--_Hamilton Wright Mabie._


As our ideal becomes loftier, so does it become more real; and the
nobler our soul, the less does it dread that it meet not a soul of its
stature; for it must have drawn near unto truth, in whose neighborhood
all things must take of its greatness.--_Maurice Materlinck._


The importance of a home it is impossible to exaggerate. What is
liberty without it? What is education in schools without it? The
greatness of no nation can be secure that is not based upon a pure home
life.--_Arnold Toynbee._


  Nay, if you come to that, best love of all
  Is God’s; then why not have God’s love befall
  Myself?
                --_Robert Browning._


  Let nothing disturb thee,
    Nothing affright thee;
  All things are passing;
    God never changeth;
  Patient endurance
    Attaineth to all things;
  Who God possesseth
    In nothing is wanting;
  Alone God sufficeth.
                --_Santa Teresa’s Book Mark._


When a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two are
cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has
the eye to contemplate the vision.--_Plato._


It is only to the finest natures that age gives an added beauty and
distinction; for the most persistent self has then worked its way to
the surface, having modified the expression, and to some extent, the
features, to its own likeness.--_Mathilde Blind._


  “God never loved me in so sweet a way before,
  ’Tis He alone who can such blessings send,
  And when His love would new expressions find,
  He brought thee to me, and He said,
      ‘Behold a friend.’”


“We can never see the sun rise by looking into the west.”


Give not thy tongue too great liberty, lest it take thee a prisoner. A
word unspoken is like the sword in the scabbard--thine: if vented, thy
sword is in another’s hand.--_Quarles._


Reputation is in itself only a farthing candle, of wavering and
uncertain flame, and easily blown out; but it is the light by which the
world looks for and finds merit.--_Lowell._


The making of friends, who are real friends, is the best token we have
of a man’s success in life.--_Edward Everett Hale._


  “It was only a glad ‘Good-morning’
    As she passed along the way,
  But it spread the morning’s glory
    Over the live long day.”


There is only one way to have good servants; that is, to be worthy
of being well served. Only let it be remembered that “kindness”
means, as with your child, so with your servant, not indulgence, but
care.--_Ruskin._


[Illustration: James Freeman Clarke

_To educate the heart, one must be willing to go out of himself and to
come into loving contact with others._]


  “Far out of sight, while sorrows still enfold us,
    Lies the fair country where our hearts abide:
  And of its bliss is naught more wondrous told us,
    Than these few words, ‘I shall be satisfied.’”


             “Though there come a million,
              Wise Saadi dwells alone.”


But it is a question as to whether Saadi is wise when he prefers to
dwell alone. Living on earth, is it not one’s duty to hear many voices
that ring in its air? Is one’s life for mere acquirement, or to show
results and flower into influence and deed?--_The World Beautiful,
Lilian Whiting._


The mountain top must be reached no matter how many times we fall in
reaching it. The fall is not counted, it does not register; the picking
up and going on counts in life.--_Flora Howard._


Success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of
concentration and perseverance.--_Chas. W. Wendte._


  Be what thou seemest; live thy creed,
  Hold up to earth the touch divine;
  Be what thou prayest to be made;
  Let the great Master’s steps be thine.
                --_Horatio Bonar._


To be honest, to be kind, to earn a little, and to spend a little
less, to make upon the whole, a family happier for his presence, to
renounce when that shall be necessary and not to be embittered, to keep
a few friends, but these without capitulation; above all, on the same
condition, to keep friends with himself, here is a task for all a man
has of fortitude and delicacy.--_Robert Louis Stevenson._


        Who is the honest man?
  He that doth still and strongly good pursue,
  To God, his neighbor and himself most true,
        Whom neither force nor fawning can
  Unpin, or wrench from giving all their due.
                --_George Herbert._


  Take the Sunday with you through the week,
  And sweeten with it all the other days.
                --_Longfellow._


  God will not mock the hope he giveth,
  No love he prompts shall vainly plead.
                --_Whittier._


  God’s goodness hath been great to thee;
  Let never day or night unhallowed pass,
  But still remember what the Lord hath done.
                --_Shakespeare._


  Yet ere we part, one lesson I can leave you
    For every day....
  Be good....
  Do noble things, not dream them, all day long:
  And so make life, death, and that vast forever
    One grand sweet song.
                --_Charles Kingsley._

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THOUGHTS ***

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
