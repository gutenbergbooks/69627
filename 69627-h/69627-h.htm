pleasant thoughts. None of us yet knows, for none of us has
been taught in early youth, what fairy palaces we may build
of beautiful thoughts—proof against all adversity. Bright

treasure-houses of precious and restful thoughts, which care

from us—houses built without hands for our souls to live
in.</p>

race? In the current of life are we moving forward? Do our years mark
milestones in humanity’s struggle towards perfection? Is the God within
us so much more unrolled, when our development has reached its highest
point? Can we transmit to our children a better heritage of brain and
soul than our fathers left to us? Has the race through us gained some
little in the direction of the law of love? If we have done our part in

<p>To live in love is to live an everlasting youth. Whoever enters old age
by this royal road will find the last of life to be the very best of
life. Instead of finding himself descending the hills of life, he will
find it up-hill all the way, into clearer air. There the vision reaches
further; here the sunsets are more golden and the twilight lasts longer.</p>

<p>Logic makes only one demand, that of conscience. But life makes a

happiness and for perfection.</p>

<p>One of the natural tendencies of the mortal mind is toward proselyting.
The moment we believe something to be true, we begin to try to convert
others to our belief. We learn to say, with some degree of realization,
“God worketh in me to will and to do of His good pleasure,” but we
quite forget that the same God is working equally in our brother “to
will and to do.” “I am the door,” says the Christ within every man’s

should never be allowed to make the man, but that man should always,
and always can, condition the environment. When we realize this, we
will find that many times it is not necessary to take ourselves out of
any particular environment, because we may yet have a work to do there;
but by the very force we carry with us, we can so affect and change
matters that we will have an entirely new set of conditions in an old
environment.</p>

<p class="nocredit">The new conditions of life demand the higher spirituality of the
individual. But what is this? Is it a name, a mental state of
exaltation, an ecstasy? Is it an exalted hour, or is it conduct? Is it
a merely theoretical thing, a vision caught in some rare hour?... If it
be thus, it may have a decorative value in ethics, but is devoid of any
practical bearing on our common life. Unless spirituality is the power
that transforms falsehood to truth, selfishness to generosity, unless
it enters into character as a pervasive force, of what use can it be?</p>

results and flower into influence and deed?</p>

<p>To be honest, to be kind, to earn a little, and to spend a little
less, to make upon the whole, a family happier for his presence, to
renounce when that shall be necessary and not to be embittered, to keep
a few friends, but these without capitulation; above all, on the same
condition, to keep friends with himself, here is a task for all a man
has of fortitude and delicacy.</p>

Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
